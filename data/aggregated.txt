ALM occurrence is reported to correlate with stress-bearing areas, which may assist in differential diagnoses. Our objective is to evaluate the distribution patterns of ALMs and AMNs on the palms and soles among Taiwanese patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed by reviewing the charts of 1400 patients diagnosed with benign and malignant pigmented lesions confirmed after excisional biopsy at our institution between 2000 and 2022 in Taiwan. Correlations between lesions and clinicopathological factors were analyzed. Results: 309 AMNs and 177 ALMs were included. Mechanical stress was significantly associated with plantar ALMs (weight-bearing area: 92.65 %, arch: 7.35 %, P < 0.001). Significant differences in the distribution patterns were observed for plantar ALMs compared with all AMNs (P < 0.001) and non-atypical AMNs (P < 0.001), but were not observed between palmar AMNs and ALMs. Conclusion: Plantar ALMs were most commonly observed on the weight-bearing areas of the soles, distinct from the distribution of all AMNs and of non-atypical AMNs. The distribution features and anatomic mapping of ALMs may facilitate the early clinical diagnosis of ALM.   Introduction Malignant melanoma is among the most serious types of skin ma.lignancy. Although cutaneous melanoma accounts for only approxi.mately 1 % of all skin cancers, it is associated with the highest mortality rate across all skin cancers. Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is the most common melanoma subtype diagnosed in Asia, contributing to over 50 % of all melanoma cases.1Ð5 Common risk factors for non-ALM cutaneous melanoma include sun exposure, ultraviolet radiation, per.sonal or family history of melanoma, fair skin, and preexisting atypical melanocytic nevi. By contrast, stress-bearing activities, penetrative in.juries, heavy exposure to agricultural chemicals, and ethnicity have been reported as risk factors for ALM. The clinical manifestations of ALM include an asymmetrical, tan-to-brown appearance with an irregular border that grows in size over time. Anatomically, ALMs most commonly develop on the palms, soles, terminal phalanges, and sub.ungual areas.6 The foot is the most common location, with an incidence 5.16-fold higher than for any other anatomical location.6,7 Clinically, melanoma is very aggressive, characterized by early metastasis, and advanced melanoma is associated with poor prognosis, highlighting the importance of early detection and diagnosis. Several benign pigmented lesions, such as acral melanocytic nevi (AMNs), blue nevi, and lentigines, also develop due to melanocytic proliferation and can present with a similar appearance and growth pattern to melanoma, which can make the clinical differential diagnosis between benign and malignant lesions difficult. Common diagnostic tools include dermoscopic examination and excisional biopsy. The novel concept that ALMs may exhibit a distinct anatomic distribution pattern was recently suggested.8 Several studies indicated that ALMs over the soles tended to develop in stress-bearing areas, such as the forefoot and heel, among Taiwanese, Japanese, and Caucasian populations.8Ð10 By contrast, AMNs over the soles tend to develop in nonÐstress-bearing areas, such as the arch, among Korean patients.11 A distinct anatomic pattern has also been reported for palmar ALMs, which tend to occur in * Corresponding author.

We established a clinical database of ALMs and AMNs identified on the palms and soles of Taiwanese patients and evaluated the correlation between mechanical stress and anatomic distribution, comparing ALMs and AMNs. We were interested in ascer.taining whether ALMs could arise from atypical AMNs. Consequently, subgroup analysis was conducted to investigate whether the distribution of atypical AMNs correlated with ALMs. Methods and materials Patients and tissues This retrospective cohort study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH-REC No.: 202201066RINC) and was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The data for 1400 patients who were clinically diagnosed with AMNs and ALMs between January 1, 2000, and January 31, 2022, at the National Taiwan University Hospital were obtained using a computer-assisted search. All cases were evaluated by at least two pathology faculty members at the time of diagnosis. Cases were included in the current analysis if they met the following inclusion criteria: 1) biopsy-confirmed AMNs or ALMs, 2) location on the plantar or palmar regions, and 3) the presence of clinical photographs with a clear presentation of size and localization. Clinicopathological data regarding patient demographics, pathohistological reports, and Breslow thickness for ALMs were collected. Patients without complete informa.tion (n = 450) and appropriate photography (n = 464) were excluded from the analysis. AMN subtypes included junctional nevi, compound nevi, intradermal nevi, dysplastic nevi, lentigo, and blue nevi. AMN lesions were divided into subgroups of atypical or non-atypical AMN. Lesions with documented nuclear atypia, architectural atypia, or cyto.logical atypia based on pathological reports were classified as atypical nevi. Anatomic mapping of AMNs and ALMs In each clinical image of a plantar lesion, the width of the foot was 2digitally magnified to 26 cm. Pixels of 0.25 cm were used to plot all plantar lesions. The soles were subdivided into five regions based on previous studies: the rear of the foot, midfoot, the front of the foot, the arch, and other areas.8,9 The front of the foot was defined as the meta.tarsal area, and the midfoot was the location of the cuboid bone. The rear, midfoot, and the front of the foot were categorized as stress-bearing areas.8,9 In each clinical image of a palmar lesion, the width of the palm was digitally magnified to 8 cm. Pixels of 0.25 cm2 were used to plot all palmar lesions. The palms were subdivided into six areas based on previous studies: thenar area, hypothenar area, metacarpal area, central triangular area, opposition area, and fingers.12Ð14 The distal portion of the transverse crease, including the metacarpal region and the fingers were categorized as the stress-bearing areas, as those areas are subject to the most mechanical stress with grip.9,12,13,15 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics and a chart review were used to summarize the clinicopathological data associated with ALMs and AMNs. Correlations between lesion localization and clinicopathological factors were evalu.ated using T-test, FisherÕs exact test, or Chi-square test, as indicated. Correlations between lesion localization and mechanical stress were evaluated using the goodness-of-fit test. Subgroup analysis was carried out to examine whether the distribution of atypical or non-atypical AMNs was correlated with ALMs. Comparisons between the distribu.tion of ALMs, all AMNs, atypical AMNs, and non-atypical AMNs were analyzed using FisherÕs exact test and Chi-square test. All tests were two- sided, and P < 0.05 was considered significant. Data processing and analysis were performed using SAS version 9.4 (Cary, North Carolina, USA). Results The final analysis included 309 AMNs (soles: n = 241; palms: n = 68) and 177 ALMs (soles: n = 167; palms: n = 10) and the characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. The histopathologic diagnoses for AMNs included junctional nevi (n = 161), compound nevi (n = 92), intradermal nevi (n = 28), dysplastic nevi (n = 6), lentigo (n = 14), and blue nevi (n = 8). In addition, 7 plantar lesions and 2 palmar lesions were classified as atypical AMNs. All ALM cases were assessed for Breslow thickness, as in situ (n = 29), 1.0 mm or less (n = 25), 1.1Ð2.0 mm (n = 37), 2.1Ð4.0 mm (n = 40), or 4.0 mm or greater (n = 46). The anatomic distributions and densities of plantar AMNs and ALMs were presented in Fig. 1. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1, the lo.cations of 241 plantar AMNs were as follows: 50 cases (0.87 lesions/ cm2) on the rear of the foot, 59 cases (1.31 lesions/cm2) on the front of the foot, 38 cases (1.08 lesions/cm2) on the midfoot, 52 cases (1.22 le.sions/cm2) on the arch, and 42 cases (0.53 lesions/cm2) on other areas. Plantar AMNs were fairly evenly distributed, and a slightly higher densities were noted for the front of the foot and the arch. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1, the locations of 167 plantar ALMs were as follows: 66 cases (1.14 lesions/cm2) on the rear of the foot, 42 cases (0.93 lesions/cm2) on the front of the foot, 18 cases (0.51 lesions/cm2) on the midfoot, 10 cases (0.24 lesions/cm2) on the arch, and 31 cases (0.39 lesions/cm2) on other areas. Among the 31 melanomas located in other area of the foot, 17 melanomas were located on the toes. Higher densities of plantar ALMs were noted for the rear and the front of the foot, with the lowest density observed for the arch. The anatomic distributions and densities of palmar AMNs and ALMs are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2, the locations of 68 cases of palmar AMNs were as follows: 15 cases (0.63 lesions/cm2) on the thenar area, 10 cases (0.48 lesions/cm2) on the hypothenar area, 9 cases (0.75 lesions/cm2) on the metacarpal area, 4 cases (0.32 lesions/ cm2) on the central triangular area, 3 cases (0.60 lesions/cm2) on the opposition area, and 27 cases (0.53 lesions/cm2) on the fingers. Higher densities of palmar AMNs were observed over the metacarpal and thenar areas. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2, the locations of 10 cases of palmar ALMs were as follows: 1 case (0.04 lesions/cm2) on the thenar area, 3 cases (0.14 lesions/cm2) on the hypothenar area, 1 case (0.08 lesions/cm2) on the metacarpal area, and 5 cases (0.10 lesions/cm2) on the fingers. Among the 5 cases on the fingers, 4 cases involved the subungual area. Higher densities of palmar ALMs were observed over the hypothenar area and the fingers. No cases of palmar ALMs were observed over the central triangular and opposition areas. The results of the goodness-of-fit test are shown in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4. Significant differences were identified between plantar ALMs distributed in weight-bearing and nonÐweight-bearing areas (P < 0.05). Comparisons of the clinicopathological factors of le.sions on stress-bearing areas with those on nonÐstress-bearing areas on the palms and soles are summarized in Tables 1Ð2 and Supplementary Table S5. No significant differences were observed except for the age among plantar AMNs. Comparisons of the palmar and plantar distribution patterns between ALMs and AMNs are shown in Table 3. Plantar ALMs and AMNs showed significant differences in distribution (P < 0.001), but no significant differences were observed for palmar distribution (P = 0.8210). Sub.group analysis revealed a significant difference between the plantar distributions of ALMs and non-atypical AMNs (P < 0.001), but no sig.nificant difference in plantar distribution was observed between ALMs and atypical AMNs (P = 0.83). No significant differences were observed S.-N.

In our study, mechanical stress was not associated with the dis.tribution patterns of either plantar or palmar AMNs, indicating that stress is unlikely to induce the generation of AMNs. These reports sug.gest that the pathogenesis of plantar ALM may be highly correlated with stress-bearing mechanisms. The correlation between plantar AMNs and mechanical stress remains unclear, and further studies remain necessary to determine whether any correlation exists. Several studies have been reported examining the distribution pat.terns of ALMs and AMNs on the palms.12,13 In our study, a higher inci.dence of palmar ALM was observed in the stress-bearing area on the volar surface of the palm, but this was not significantly different from the incidence observed for nonÐstress-bearing areas. The result was consistent with the findings of previous studies.12,13 However, the palmar AMN distribution in our study was not consistent with the results of a Japanese study, which reported that AMNs were more commonly found in the area proximal to the transverse crease.12 In a Spanish study, a high incidence of palmar ALM was reported in the subungual area (8 of Table 3 Comparison of AMN and ALM distributions and sites.  Body Sites AMN ALM (%) All (%) Atypical Non-atypical (%) (%) Sole Rear Midfoot Front Arch Others Palm Thenar Hypothenar Metacarpal Central triangular Oppose Fingers (n = 241) 50 (20.75 %) 38 (15.77 %) 59 (24.48 %) 52 (21.58 %) 42 (17.43 %) (n = 68) 15 (22.06 %) 10 (14.71 %) 9 (13.24 %) 4 (5.88 %) 3 (4.41 %) 27 (39.71 %) (n = 7) 2 (28.57 %) 1 (14.29 %) 2 (28.57 %) 0 (0 %) 2 (28.57 %) (n = 2) 1 (50 %) 0 (0 %) 0 (0 %) 0 (0 %) 0 (0 %) 1 (50 %) (n = 234) 48 (20.51 %) 37 (15.81 %) 57 (24.36 %) 52 (22.22 %) 40 (17.09 %) (n = 66) 14 (21.21 %) 10 (15.15 %) 9 (13.64 %) 4 (6.06 %) 3 (4.55 %) 26 (39.39 %) (n = 167)a 66 (39.52 %) 18 (10.78 %) 42 (25.15 %) 10 (5.99 %) 31 (18.56 %) (n = 10) 1 (10 %) 3 (30 %) 1 (10 %) 0 (0 %) 0 (0 %) 5 (50 %)  a P values were <0.0001 when comparing ALMs with all AMNs and non-atypical AMNs AMN, acral melanocytic nevus; ALM, acral lentiginous melanoma. 16 cases).13 A similar phenomenon was observed in our study, as sub.ungual melanoma comprised 40 % of palmar ALM cases. The mechanism underlying subungual melanoma involves the pigmentation of the nail bed, and patients who suffer several direct traumatic injuries over the nails may be predisposed to the development of subungual mel.anoma.18Ð20 Due to the high incidence of subungual melanomas re.ported in these studies, the presence of subungual pigmented lesions combined with a history of repeated traumatic injuries to the nail beds should be considered warning signs for the potential evolution of sub.ungual melanoma. It is suggested that many melanomas, including acral and mucosal melanomas, arise de novo, not from melanocytic nevus.23 The distri.bution pattern for ALMs was significantly different from those for all AMNs and non-atypical AMNs in our study, a finding similar to the re.sults reported by previous studies.17 Furthermore, there was no signif.icant difference observed in the distribution patterns between atypical AMNs and ALMs. This suggests that atypical AMNs and ALMs may share a similar distribution pattern. However, it is essential to obtain more clinical data due to the limited number of cases in our study. The lack of significance in our results may be attributed to the reduced statistical power resulting from the subdivision of the sample size into subgroups. ItÕs crucial to emphasize that further clinical data are required to vali.date this finding, given the studyÕs limited case inclusion. A distinct pathogenic mechanism has been suggested for ALM rela.tive to other cutaneous melanoma due to differences in mutations and distributions.24Ð28 The dysregulation of the MAPK pathway due to BRAF and NRAS mutation has been identified in 80 % of sporadic melanoma cases.24Ð27 However, ALM has relatively higher frequencies of NRAS, NF1, and KIT mutations and a lower frequency of BRAF muta.tions.24,25,28 A recent study sequenced the ALM genome and found the specific enrichment of CRKL amplifications; an in vivo model was also established, which revealed that acral melanocytes were more suscep.tible to CRKL transformation than melanocytes located at other anatomic sites.25 This finding suggests that the oncogenes responsible for melanoma development may present with positional dependence. In addition, mechanical stress and chronic trauma have been hypothesized to play important roles in the development of ALM.8Ð13 The long-term burdens of weight-bearing and shear stress that stress-bearing areas S.-N. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                are subjected to may result in more frequent skin breakdown.8,9,29 A recent article reported that weight-bearing activities could cause im.pairments to the nuclear membrane and disrupt genome integrity in plantar melanoma, promoting mutagenesis.30 This may also explain the insignificant results of distributions among palmar ALMs and AMNs considering the palms are not under similar stress as the soles. The scarcity of point mutations in acral melanoma is in stark contrast to the notable abundance of copy number and structural aberrations.31 Spe.cifically, this includes the occurrence of multiple amplifications, de.letions, and intra-and inter-chromosomal rearrangements.32Ð34 It is speculated that the complex genetic aberrations affecting normal me.lanocytes, serve as the initiating events of acral melanoma. These ab.errations may include double-stranded DNA break, possibly induced by physical force, and are considered a significant mutational mechanism in the activation of oncogenes.23,30 Future studies may focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying location-specific and stress-induced oncogenesis to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying ALM. A strength of our research was the anatomic mapping and analysis of ALM and AMN distributions among the Taiwanese population, which may facilitate the differentiation of pigmented lesions. The earlier detection and diagnosis of malignant lesions allows for timely treatment and the avoidance of metastasis. However, our study also has several limitations. First, due to the retrospective nature of the study, important clinical information was not collected, such as occupation, trauma his.tory, and irritant exposure history. Second, the numbers of palmar ALMs and atypical AMNs cases were insufficient, and more data are needed. Third, the sole was divided into 5 subunits and the palm was divided into 6 subunits in our study, but the exact pressure applied to each lesion site was not collected by pedobarography or sensor gloves.30 Future work involving a larger database and more precise measurements to assess stress remains necessary. Conclusion Summarizing our results, stress-bearing areas are more common lo.cations for the development of plantar ALM, whereas plantar AMN, palmar ALM and AMN showed no preferences for either stress-bearing or nonÐstress-bearing areas. Significant differences were observed in the distributions of plantar ALM and AMN and no significant differences were observed between the distributions of palmar ALM and AMN. The anatomic locations of melanoma are associated with distinct molecular and clinical subtypes. Even within the skin, melanocytes residing in different anatomic sites can have different susceptibilities to transformation. Conflicts of interest None. Funding statement This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 109-2314-B-002-051-MY3], National Science and Technology Council [NSTC 112-2314-B-002-075-MY3], and National Taiwan University Hospital [NTUH-111S0233, NTUH 111-UN0028, NTUH-112S0171]. Acknowledgements This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Sciences and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan [MOST 109-2314-B-002-051-MY3], National Science and Technology Council [NSTC 112-2314-B-002-075- MY3], [MOST 112-2314-B-002-075-MY3] and the National Taiwan University Hospital [NTUH 111-S0233; NTUH 111-UN0028; NTUH-112S0171].

Mycosis fungoides and SŽzary syndrome are includ.ed in the spectrum of CTCL. This spectrum also includes alopecia mucinosis, pagetoid reticulosis or Woringer-Kolopp disease, granulomatous slack skin, hypopigmented mycosis fungoides, and papuloerythrodermic mycosis fun.goides. The diagnosis of CTCL is based on clinical and pathological findings and has been improved by immunophenotyping and molecular techniques, including assessment of T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. Once a diagnosis of CTCL has been confirmed, assessment of the extent of cutaneous and extra-cutaneous involvement is essential for staging. A number of staging classifica.tions have been used to determine prognosis and optimal therapy. Although extensive information has been published on the biology and pathophysiology of CTCL, including recent evidence about mutations in tumor suppressor genes, initial management has not changed dramatically over the last several decades. This is due, in part, to the excellent prognosis when cutaneous involvement is limited. Topical nitrogen mustard, psoralen plus UV-A, and total skin electron beam radiation are the mainstay of treatment for T1 or stage I disease, with 5.year survival rates over 90%. More innovative treatments have been examined for cutaneous tumors or generalized erythroderma (T3 or T4 disease) because long-term survival is below 40% with traditional therapies. In this issue of Current Problems in Dermatology, Drs Kim-James and Heffernan provide an in-depth and up-to-date review of this complex area. Clinical features, pathogene.sis, diagnosis, staging, and therapy are discussed. Newer therapeutic modalities including monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, interleukin-2 fusion toxin, and vac.cines have been included. The authors have provided an important, up-to-date, comprehensive review that is not only useful for the general dermatologic com.munity but also a valuable resource document for those working in the field. Daniel N.

Mycosis fungoides and the SŽzary syndrome are the most common forms, with approximately 1000 cases yearly. The median age at onset is 55 years, and the male predominance is 2:1. The etiology of mycosis fungoides is unknown. Infectious, genetic, and environmental sources have been proposed. Mycosis fungoides typically presents as patches or plaques that may progress to tumors over time. The SŽzary syndrome is the leukemic variant of CTCL characterized by lymphadenopathy, generalized erythroderma, and severe pruritus. As the severity of involvement increases, spread to extracutaneous sites may occur. Diagnosis relies primarily on skin biopsy with routine histologic evaluation. Presently, there is no cure for CTCL. Current treatment includes topical thera.py, phototherapy, radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. The most reliable predictors of response to therapy are the stage of disease and the presence of extracutaneous involve.ment. (Curr Prob Dermatol 2001;13:301-40.) Curr Probl Dermatol, November/December 2001 Introduction Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a spectrum of extranodal non-HodgkinÕs lymphomas linked by primary cutaneous involvement of a dominant T-cell clone. Mycosis fungoides and SŽzary syndrome are the most common subsets of CTCL. Mycosis fun.goides is distinguished from other CTCL by its unique clinical and histologic features. In 1806 the French dermatologist Alibert first de.scribed mycosis fungoides in a patient with a skin eruption that progressed to mushroom-shaped tumors.1 Mycosis fungoides typically manifests as an indolent cutaneous eruption with erythematous scaly patches or plaques and may progress to generalized erythroder.ma, cutaneous tumors, or extracutaneous involvement. A pre-mycotic period with nonspecific scaly skin eruptions may precede the diagnosis of mycosis fun.goides by several months to several years.2,3 Prognosis varies from prolonged survival to an aggressive, rapid.ly progressive, fatal outcome. SŽzary syndrome, described by SŽzary and Bouvrain4 in 1938, is the leukemic variant of CTCL character.ized by lymphadenopathy, generalized erythroderma, and severe pruritus. Neoplastic T cells (SŽzary cells) can be found in the peripheral blood. Patients may pre.sent with all components of SŽzary syndrome or with only one element, commonly erythroderma, and then progress to development of the other characteristic features. Clinical Features Mycosis fungoides often has a long indolent history. Early lesions may mimic an eczematous process and may require sequential biopsies to establish the diag.nosis.5 A pre-mycotic phase, with a median 6-year duration, often precedes the diagnosis of mycosis fun.goides and SŽzary syndrome.2 Patients may have many years of nonspecific skin lesions and nondiagnostic skin biopsy results. The lesions may respond to topical corticosteroids or may wax and wane even when untreated. Many patients in this pre-mycotic phase might never progress to mycosis fungoides, whereas characteristic patches and plaques with diagnostic skin biopsy results develop in others. The concept of para.psoriasis en plaques as a pre-mycosis fungoides process is controversial. Curr Probl Dermatol 2001;13:301-40. doi:10.1067/mdm.2001.119860 In 1876 Bazin proposed that mycosis fungoides falls into 3 general categories: nonspecific erythematous patches (pre-mycotic), infiltrated plaques (lichenoid), and tumors (fungoid).6 We now recognize 4 distinct skin lesions: patch, plaque, tumors, and erythroderma. These phases may be distinct or overlapping at diag.nosis. Patches may be single or multiple and are ery.thematous and slightly scaly. Mycosis fungoides typi.cally presents in a Òbathing suitÓ distribution including the hips, buttocks, thighs, lower abdomen, axilla, and breasts,1,2,5,7 although any body surface may be affected. Patches may be asymptomatic or intensely pruritic. Repeated excoriation often results in secondary lichenification.2 Plaques are well marginated, raised, and erythema.tous (Fig 1).5 They may arise from established patches or from unaffected skin. Plaques may be annular, angulated, or serpiginous. Leonine facies results from malignant T-cell infiltration leading to extensive thick.ening and skin-fold accentuation (Fig 2). Involvement of hairy surfaces may result in alopecia or follicular mucinosis. Disease can extend to the eyelids and the external auditory canals.2 The palms and soles can develop hyperkeratosis and skin fissuring.1,2 Dystro.phic nails, poikiloderma, and hypopigmentation may also occur.2 Patients typically have intense pruritus. More extensive skin involvement can evolve into gen.eralized erythroderma, lÕhomme rouge,2 involving the entire skin with or without exfoliation (Fig 3). Tumors may develop from patches, from plaques, or de novo (Fig 4). Tumors more commonly arise on the face and body folds.5 Pruritus may be less severe with tumors. However, tumors often develop necrosis, ulcerate, and become infected. The rate of progression, if any, from patch to plaque to tumor is unpredictable.1 In 1885 Videl and Brocq8 described the tumors dÕem.blee variant as mycosis fungoides presenting with tumors. This form is rare, occurring in less than 5% to 10% of patients with mycosis fungoides,5 and has been disputed by some as representing a lymphoma with secondary skin involvement; however, Blasik et al6 maintain that it is a distinct entity. The most com.mon extracutaneous site of involvement is the lymph node.9 Extensive peripheral blood involvement can occur late in the disease. Five percent of patients with CTCL have SŽzary syn-drome,10 which presents as a triad of erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, and circulating SŽzary cells. The SŽzary cell is a malignant T cell with a hyperconvo.luted, cerebriform nucleus.11,12 The number of cells FIG 1. Plaque-stage lesion of mycosis fungoides demonstrating ery.thema and scale.

Other clinical features in.clude fever or chills, weight loss, generalized malaise, insomnia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly,2 leonine facies, FIG 3.

The annual inci.dence of mycosis fungoides in the United States is Curr Probl Dermatol, November/December 2001 estimated at 0.42 per 100,000,10 approximately 1000 new cases each year. The incidence increased from 0.19 cases per 100,000 in 1973 to 0.42 cases per 100,000 in 1984.10 Furthermore, the proportion of all lymphomas identified as mycosis fungoides also increased during this period from 1.6% to 2.8%. This increase is not merely reflective of improved diagnos.tic criteria, as improved survival rates from earlier detection and treatment would be expected.13 Mycosis fungoides and SŽzary syndrome are typically diseases of older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 55 years.2,5,11 Prevalence also rises sharply with advanc.ing age.10,14 Mycosis fungoides is twice as common in men as women, and African Americans outnumber white patients 2.2:1.2,10 Etiology The etiology of mycosis fungoides and SŽzary syn.drome remains unknown. Formal case reports and studies have suggested infectious, genetic, and envi.ronmental sources. Five viruses have been studied for linkage to CTCL: human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-I/II/V), her.pes simplex virus, human herpesvirus 6, Epstein-Barr virus, and human immunodeficiency virus.1,15-17 Studies have focused on a causal relationship between HTLV-I and CTCL because HTLV-I is associated with CTCL/leukemia; however, HTLV-I antibodies have been found in fewer than 1 in 10 patients with myco.sis fungoides.13,18 Mycosis fungoides was thought by Alibert to be transmissible within a family.19 However, subsequent studies have found only 3 definitive cases of familial mycosis fungoides.19 Patients with mycosis fungoides and SŽzary syndrome have been reported to have chro.mosomal abnormalities and oncogene alterations. A specific chromosomal abnormality at the region between 1p22 and 1p36 has been described in the pro.gression or malignant transformation (or both) of mycosis fungoides and SŽzary syndrome.20 Further.more, an increased occurrence of HLA antigens B8 and Bw35 has been identified in some patients.21 Cytokines and growth factors have also been proposed in the pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides and SŽzary syndrome. Environmental toxins have been postulated to stimu.late an abnormal immune response. Possible contribu.tors include history of atopy, prior viral or fungal skin infections, family history of malignancy, sun sensitiv.ity, toxin exposure, and a manufacturing occupation.22 One study implicated multiple exposures to air pollu.tants, pesticides, solvents and vapors, detergents, tobacco, analgesics, tranquilizers, and thiazides.23 A case-control study by Tuyp et al24 investigated occu.pational, recreational, and chemical or environmental exposure to potential carcinogens and demonstrated no association with mycosis fungoides. Similarly, Whittemore et al25 found no association between patients with mycosis fungoides and control subjects with respect to occupational or chemical exposure. Histopathology Skin biopsy with routine histologic evaluation is the most important procedure for establishing the diagno.sis of mycosis fungoides. Consensus for establishing histologic diagnostic criteria has yet to be reached. In the early patch phase, it may be difficult to distinguish mycosis fungoides from nonspecific chronic inflam.mation histologically, and sequential biopsies are often needed to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. Secondary alterations within mycosis fungoides lesions, including epidermal ulceration, secondary bacterial infection, and follicular mucinosis, may alter histopathologic appearance.2 The use of topical corticosteroids may make diagnosis difficult, and when there is strong clin.ical suspicion of CTCL, the patient should stop the use of corticosteroids for 2 to 4 weeks and then undergo repeat biopsy. As patients are treated with mechlor.ethamine, electron beam, or psoralen plus UV-A (PUVA), histologic changes occur. Biopsy specimens have a deeper infiltrate, more atypia, prominent fibro.sis, increased melanophages, and spongiosis. The earliest changes seen in mycosis fungoides in.clude a sparse, superficial patchy or perivascular lym.phocytic infiltrate, slight epidermotropism, and occa.sional spongiosis.2,26 Mycosis fungoides cells display a predilection for keratinocytes, perhaps due to inter.action with LangerhansÕ cells. Lymphocytic atypia, plasma cells, and eosinophils are rare.26 Within plaques, lymphoid cells in the upper dermis have hyperchromatic, convoluted nuclei and scant cytoplasm.2 Mononuclear cells are found within the papillary dermis as isolated Òhaloed cellsÓ or in the epidermis as collections surrounded by a clear halo, PautrierÕs microabscess, or microaggregation (Figs 5 and 6).5 There is psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis and focal parakeratosis.5 Epider.motropism, basal cell layer predilection, lymphocytic atypia, and PautrierÕs microabscesses help distinguish CTCL from dermatitis.27 FIG 5.

The dermis contains a band-like infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes. Courtesy of Anne Lind, MD, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Mo. In the tumor phase the infiltrate extends from the upper and lower dermis into the subcutaneous fat. Cells may undergo degrees of transformation and lose epidermotropic properties.9 A Grenz zone, a sparing of a thin superficial layer of papillary dermis from deeper malignant T cells, may appear.2 The atypical lymphocyte found in mycosis fungoides and SŽzary syndrome has a characteristic cerebriform nucleus. However, this nucleus is also found in benign dermatologic disorders such as solar keratoses, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and lichen planus.28 The nuclear contour index was developed to correlate the degree of nuclear convolution with malignancy.29 Reactive T-cell processes have low nuclear contour index values, whereas mycosis fungoides and SŽzary syndrome have higher values, but substantial overlap exists. The National Cancer Institute Classification for lymph node grading in mycosis fungoides/SŽzary syndrome shown in Table 1 categorizes lymph node involvement based on the composition of atypical cells. Grade LN.4 is involved with mycosis fungoides, whereas grades LN-1, LN-2, and LN-3 are dermatopathic.30 Cytokine, Immunohistochemical, and Molecular Markers Primary cutaneous lymphomas are divided into T-cell and B-cell immunophenotypes. Approximately 65% of cutaneous lymphomas are T-cell immunophe-FIG 6. High-power view of epidermis displaying PautrierÕs microab.scesses.

Immunohistochemistry has been most useful in dis.cerning cutaneous lymphoma lineages as T or B cell.31 Malignant T cells typically display epidermotropism, whereas malignant B cells are usually separated from the epidermis.32 Normal cutaneous T cells predominantly express CD2, CD3, CD45RO, and CLA.33 As cells undergo malignant transformation, loss of cell-surface proteins can be identified. The pan-T-cell antigen most com.monly absent is CD7 (Leu9), followed by CD2, CD3, and CD5.32 The absence of CD7 has been shown to represent an expansion of a T-cell population not expressing the antigen rather than the loss of antigen from existing cells.34 Loss of CD7 expression is also identified in 10% to 20% of benign cutaneous T-cell processes,2 so this finding is not diagnostic of mycosis fungoides or SŽzary syndrome. The T-cell receptor has been an area of intense research because it confers specificity to antigen expression.35 The T-cell receptor is a disulfide-linked heterodimer composed of 1 of 2 protein complexes, ... or .-..31,36 During T-cell maturation, the .-. complex undergoes the first gene rearrangement. If this does not yield a viable protein, the .-. complex then under.goes rearrangement as well.37 Molecular techniques may demonstrate a clonal gene rearrangement. Clo.nality is demonstrable in 75% of CTCL but also in approximately 5% of benign processes.38 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can also be used to establish the diagnosis of CTCL and in the evaluation of clinical Curr Probl Dermatol, November/December 2001 TABLE 1.

Southern blot analysis, which has been shown to detect circulating T-cell clones at levels of 1% of the circulating population,37 can be used in cases in which flow cytometry is equivocal. Southern blot analysis identifies T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements through the presence of expanded T-cell clones; however, its clinical utility is limited because a tumor concentration of less than 5% of the sample cells may produce a negative result.32 PCR amplification of .-chain T-cell receptor gene rearrange.ments can detect more than 90% of T-cell clone popu.lations in skin biopsy specimens.38 This method re.quires tumor cell concentrations ranging from 0.001% to 1.0%, but it may detect similar rearrangements in reactive processes.32,33,38 The RNAase protection assay evaluates the messenger RNA (mRNA) of circu.lating lymphocytes for T-cell receptor analysis to demonstrate clonality. Diagnosis and Evaluation The initial evaluation for mycosis fungoides begins with a comprehensive history and physical examination with an emphasis on body distribution of lesions and lymph node, liver, and spleen examination. The diagno.sis of mycosis fungoides relies primarily on biopsy of involved skin. Establishing a diagnosis may require multiple biopsies taken over months to years. Skin biop.sy results are important in distinguishing early mycosis fungoides from benign processes, such as large plaque parapsoriasis,2 or other cutaneous lymphomas (Fig 7). In the setting of equivocal histology, laboratory testing (complete blood count [CBC] including smear exami.nation for SŽzary cells), flow cytometry, immunoperox.idase for T-cell marker loss, and evaluation of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement may help to confirm the diagnosis. However, the diagnosis is best made by his.tology, and therefore repeat biopsy every 6 to 12 months when oneÕs clinical suspicion is high is not unreason.able. Regular imaging is not recommended. Repeat evaluation during follow-up of patients with CTCL consists of an updated history and physical examination, including evaluation for lymphadenopa.thy and hepatosplenomegaly, and laboratory tests (peripheral blood smear for SŽzary cells and serum lactate dehydrogenase). Repeat skin biopsy after diag.nosis may be necessary when a patient has recurrence after therapy or development of new lesions such as tumors. When palpable lymphadenopathy exists, biop.sy or fine needle aspiration is indicated. If visceral involvement is suggested by a review of systems or physical examination, further appropriate imaging and histologic evaluations may be pursued. Because SŽzary cells are not commonly identified in peripheral blood, their presence reflects significant bone marrow involvement and, therefore, bone marrow biopsy is not usually helpful.11 Classification Historically, CTCL classification has lacked con.sensus. Different classifications used have included the Kiel, Working Formulation, and Lukes-Collins lymphoma classifications.32 In 1994 a revised lym.phoma classification was established that incorporat.ed morphologic, immunologic, and genetic features. This classification, the Revised European-American Lymphoma Classification (REAL), was created by the International Lymphoma Study Group. Thereafter the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Lymphoma Program Project Group designed a classification specifically for primary cuta.neous lymphomas, with the additional consideration of clinical presentation and biologic behavior. Dif.ferences between the EORTC, Kiel, and REAL classi.fications are highlighted in Table 2.39 Staging A tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system for mycosis fungoides and SŽzary syndrome was pro-FIG 7. Spectrum of disease. posed by the Mycosis Fungoides Cooperative Group in 1979.40 Modeled after the TNM classification sys.tem of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging, this system focused on skin stage (T), periph.eral lymph node involvement (N), and visceral organ involvement (M). Peripheral blood involvement corre.lates with the extent of skin disease and the presence of lymph node involvement, but it is not considered to be an independent prognostic factor.2,40 Since then, revisions have been proposed in an effort to better determine course and prognosis. In 1984 Lamberg et al41 described 4 clinical stages based only on physical examination to ascribe clinical prognosis in CTCL. This design is based on skin involvement (T0-T4) and extent of nodal involvement (N0-N8). Presently, the standard clinical staging system for CTCL is the TNMB classification (Tables 3 and 4), which is based on type and extent of skin involvement (T), lymph node involvement (N), presence of viscer.al disease (M), and detection of SŽzary cells in the peripheral blood (B). This is a modification of the original TNM staging system by Sausville et al.42 Patients are classified to clinical stages I through IV based on the extent of skin, node, and visceral disease involvement. Stage I disease is limited to the skin (lim.ited patch or plaque disease <10% of total skin surface [IA] and generalized patch or plaque disease ³10% of total skin surface [IB]). Stage II disease is subdivided into patch or plaque disease with palpable lymphade.nopathy (IIA) and cutaneous tumors with or without palpable lymphadenopathy (IIB). Stage III disease is generalized erythroderma with (IIIA) or without (IIIB) palpable lymphadenopathy. Stage IV disease is char.acterized by extracutaneous involvement (limited to lymph nodes [IVA] and visceral involvement [IVB]). The B (blood) classification does not alter clinical stage. Staging is important. As we will discuss later, therapy choices are mostly determined by the stage of disease. Prognosis Results from a multicenter study of 152 patients suggested that 3 distinctive prognostic groups existed: good risk, intermediate risk, and poor risk.42 Good risk (stages IA, IB, and IIA) includes patch or plaque skin lesions without lymph node, peripheral blood, or vis.ceral involvement with a median survival of more than 12 years. Intermediate risk (stages IIB, III, and IVA) includes plaques, tumors, or erythroderma with lymph node or blood involvement but no visceral involve.ment. These patients have a median survival of 5 years. Poor risk (stage IVB) includes visceral involvement or complete lymph node effacement, and the median sur.vival falls to 2.5 years.42 Interest in classification rests on its utility in assessing prognosis and treatment of CTCL patients. Studies focusing on prognostic indicators of mycosis fungoides have consistently demonstrated that the T stage is the most important determinant of survival. Stage T1 (skin involvement) has an excellent progno.sis, whereas stages T3 (tumor) and T4 (erythrodermic) have poor prognoses. Similarly, lymph node or visceral involvement or the presence of SŽzary cells also car.ries a poor prognosis. The clinical course is best pre.dicted by assessment of the proliferating T cells: tumor burden, degree of atypia, and host immunocom.petence.43 Median survival data studies from Stanford University demonstrated that nearly all patients with T1 disease died from causes unrelated to mycosis fun.goides, whereas patients with T2, T3, and T4 disease demonstrated median survivals of 11 years, 3.2 years, and 4.6 years, respectively.11,44 Identified adverse prognostic markers include the presence of cutaneous tumors, generalized erythroder.ma, lymph node enlargement or effacement, SŽzary cells, eosinophilia, or visceral involvement. Other inde.pendent variables include serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value and thickness of cutaneous infiltrate.45 Age may be an independent prognostic indicator, as Curr Probl Dermatol, November/December 2001 TABLE 2.

A study of patients with stage T4 disease at Stanford University identified age at presentation, sex, race, duration of symptoms preceding diagnosis, lymph node involvement, peripheral blood involvement, and first response to treatment as indicators of improved sur.vival.48 Extracutaneous involvement typically correlates with the type and extent of skin involvement: its occur.rence is very rare in stage T1 disease; 8% in stage T2; 30% in stage T3; and most likely, at 42%, in stage T4.11,48 The most frequent extracutaneous site of involvement is the lymph nodes. Other premortem findings include the lungs, spleen, liver, and gastroin.testinal tract.11 Autopsy most frequently reveals lymph node (75%), lung (66%), liver (53%), and spleen (60%) involvement.49 Visceral involvement is associ.ated with a median survival of 25 months.50 Transformation to an anaplastic large cell lymphoma (CD30+/Ð) in mycosis fungoides and SŽzary syndrome carries a poor prognosis with a median survival of 2 to 19 months.51,52 The transformation rate has been reported to be from 8% to 23%.51-54 Unfavorable prog.nosis is associated with advanced stage of skin disease (IIB-IV) at the time of transformation, early transfor.mation (<2 years from initial diagnosis),52 and extra-cutaneous transformation.54 TABLE 3.

A positive relationship exists between the number of these cells and prognosisÑmore suppressor T cells suggest a better survival.33,57 Berger et al55 proposed that the host immune responseÕs limited ability to con.tain CTCL invasion reflects reduced expression of tumor-specific antigen on malignant cells rather than a deficiency of functioning cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Despite normal-range total T-cell counts, nonmalignant CD4+ T cells have been found to be remarkably decreased58 in patients with CTCL who have advanc.ing disease. Immunosuppression contributes to death from infection in approximately 50% of patients with CTCL.58-60 Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common agents.50,59 Other immunologic abnormalities identified in patients with CTCL include eosinophilia, increased immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgE production, decreased T-cell response to mitogens, and decreased natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activities.33,60,61 A common causality may be ascribed to aberrations in cytokine production of the malignant T cells with an increased production of interleukin (IL) 4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10.33 Decreased NK and LAK cell activity could be related to increased levels of IL-4.60 Eosinophilia and increased IgA and TABLE 4.

Current treat.ment options focus primarily on the destruction of malignant cells and the enhancement of host immunity. Response to treatment depends on stage of disease and type of treatment. To minimize adverse effects, con.servative treatment is preferred in the early stages of disease, but more aggressive treatment often becomes necessary with disease progression. Treatment success is defined by the degree of response attained. Com.plete response (CR) describes full resolution of dis.ease for a minimum of 4 weeks, and partial response (PR) refers to greater than 50% resolution over the same time period. The overall response rate (ORR) gives the percentage of patients attaining any appre.ciable response to a particular therapy. The stage of disease and the presence of extracutaneous involve.ment are the most reliable predictors of response to therapy. Relapse is common. Current treatment options include topical therapy, phototherapy, single or combination systemic therapy, and immunotherapy. Mechanism of action, dosing, clinical studies, and adverse effects are discussed for each therapeutic modality. Information on study clas.sification and duration of response is included when available. Topical Therapy Data regarding topical therapy are shown in Table 5. Topical Corticosteroids.

Farber et al64 noted a rapid involution of lesions in patients with mycosis fungoides who were treated with topical fluocinolone acetonide for skin irritation as a result of electron beam radiation. Subsequently, 3 con.centrations of topical fluocinolone therapy with occlu.sive dressing were evaluated in 6 patients with plaque-stage mycosis fungoides, and an ORR of 100% was obtained.64 Side effects were minimal, but the authors noted that patients should be monitored for the devel.opment of hypercorticalism and local skin atrophy. In 1961 Cohen and Baer65 successfully treated 2 patients who had mycosis fungoides with 0.5% triam.cinolone cream. An additional study involving 20 patients with mycosis fungoides who were treated with fluocinolone similarly concluded that high concentra.tions of topical corticosteroids may suppress early stages of mycosis fungoides; however, they are rela.tively ineffectual in treating thicker plaques, nodules, and tumors.66 Another study obtained less favorable treatment results. Marsden67 treated 13 patients who had myco.sis fungoides with fluocinolone acetonide cream 0.2% and obtained an ORR of 46% with a CR of 15%. Adverse effects were minimal, and there was no clini.cal evidence of systemic absorption. A recent prospective study evaluated the efficacy of class I to III topical corticosteroids in 72 patients with patch or plaque mycosis fungoides. CR was seen in 63% of T1 and 25% of T2 patients.68 Minimal adverse effects included reversible depression of serum corti.sol levels, minor skin irritation, and localized revers.ible skin atrophy.68 Topical Mechlorethamine/Nitrogen Mustard. Mech.lorethamine was developed between World Wars I and II as a potential chemical warfare agent.69 An alkylat.ing agent, nitrogen mustard (HN2), damages nucleic acids through depurination, abnormal base pairing, imidazole ring cleavage, and cross-linkage between DNA chains.69,70 Mechlorethamine was first used for the treatment of mycosis fungoides in the 1950s. It is available in aqueous, ointment, and polyethylene gly.col lotion vehicles. HN2, 10 to 40 mg/dL, is adminis.tered once or twice daily until skin clearance, followed by a variable duration of maintenance therapy. Treat.ment of the entire skin surface is recommended, but application only to affected areas may be used. Hoppe et al71 treated 123 patients with mycosis fun.goides, stages I-III, with aqueous or ointment-based HN2 from 1969-1985. An overall CR was obtained in 32%, with CR in 51% T1, 26% T2, 0% T3, and 22% T4. After achieving a CR, many patients relapsed with a median time to relapse of 3.6 years. Subsequent ther.apies, including additional courses of HN2, were often successful in achieving skin clearance. At last follow.up, 42% of T1 and 31% of T2 patients continued to be without clinical disease.71 A clinical trial conducted at Temple University eval.uated the use of topical HN2 in 140 patients with patch- or plaque-stage mycosis fungoides.72 Ninety-eight patients were treated with only topical HN2, and 42 received a course of systemic methotrexate or sys.temic HN2 in addition to topical HN2. An overall CR rate of 78% was attained, with 46% of patients contin.uing to be without disease at last follow-up (median duration of follow-up >18 months).72 Vonderheid et al73 subsequently evaluated the med.ical records of 331 patients with CTCL who were treated with HN2 from 1968-1982 at Temple Univer.sity. An overall CR rate of 67% (CR in 80% T1, 62% T2, 36% T3, and 42% T4) was reported, with 65 of 331 having CR for 4 to 14 years. They concluded that permanent eradication of CTCL can be achieved in patients with disease limited to the skin and that cures from topical HN2 therapy do not require long-term maintenance treatment.73 Because type 1 cytokines mediate anti-tumor cell-mediated immunity, augmentation of these responses may be beneficial in CTCL.74 Skin testing on HN2.treated patients with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) measures type IV T-cellÐmediated immune responses. Thus a clinical trial showed that patients who were DNCB reactive were significantly less likely to have disease progression develop and had a better overall prognosis than DNCB-negative patients.74 The most significant side effect of topical HN2 was the early and frequent development of allergic contact dermatitis in up to 67% of patients.75,76 Percutaneous hyposensitization has been used with variable success to minimize hypersensitivity.77 Ointment-based HN2 rather than aqueous-based HN2 also reduces hypersen.sitivity reactions.71,78 Ointment-based HN2 increases patient compliance, minimizes skin drying, and de.creases cost of therapy.78 Other adverse effects of HN2 include erythema with or without accompanying tenderness, telangiectasia, and hyperpigmentation.79 Because topical HN2 is not systemically absorbed, systemic complications, such as myelosuppression, are not observed. Long-term topical HN2 application has not been shown to induce pulmonary fibrosis.80 Topical HN2 has been associated with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carci.noma (BCC), HodgkinÕs disease, and colon cancer with relative risks of 7.8, 1.8, 58.9, and 2.6, respec.tively,73 although this may be overstated. In addition, Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been reported with topical HN2 therapy in a patient with stage IB mycosis fungoides who was treated for 30 days.81 Drug resistance to topical HN2 is estimated to be responsible for recurrent disease in 20% of patients with mycosis fungoides.82 This phenomenon may be mediated by development of cellular resistance with continued HN2 administration or inadequate skin pen.etration over time.77 To overcome drug resistance, it has been proposed that therapy be discontinued imme.diately after complete remission and treatment not restarted until relapse occurs.77 Carmustine. Carmustine (BCNU), a nitrosourea.alkylating agent, is effective in early CTCL. Typical treatment is available as an aqueous solution or oint.ment and involves application of 10 or 20 mg once daily. Duration of therapy is kept to less than 6 months because, despite topical application, BCNU may be systemically absorbed. Myelosuppression is rare for the 10-mg dosing and less than 10% for the 20-mg dosing.83 Mild reversible elevations in blood urea nitrogen and aspartate transaminase have been reported in earlier studies.84,85 Routine monitoring for myelo.suppression and electrolyte disturbances includes CBC at initiation of treatment and every 4 weeks for the 10-mg dosing or every 2 weeks for the 20-mg dos.ing and serum chemistry panel every 3 months. Several studies conducted by Zackheim et al83-85 have obtained an ORR of 68% to 100% for T1 myco.sis fungoides and 42% to 76% for T2 mycosis fun.goides. In a 10-year period, topical BCNU therapy in 86 patients who had mycosis fungoides achieved a CR in 84% stage IA and 52% stage IB, with a median duration of 12 months and 23 months, respectively.84 As predicted, patients with more superficial lesions and less total body surface involvement responded more favorably. A more recent study involving 172 patients with patch- or plaque-stage mycosis fun.goides attained an ORR of 92% for stage T1 and 64% for stage T2.83 Stage T1 responders did not reach a median duration as a result of a low failure rate. The median duration of stage T2 was 86 months.83 Dura-Curr Probl Dermatol, November/December 2001 tion of response and survival were focused upon in the analysis of the efficacy of BCNU treatment. Patients who had a relapse were often able to achieve subse.quent CR or PR with additional BCNU therapy. The 5.year survival rate was 97% for stage T1 and 79% for stage T2.83 Hypersensitivity reactions are less common with BCNU (3%) than with HN284 and rarely lead to dis.continuance of therapy.83 Furthermore, patients with delayed hypersensitivity to topical HN2 do not cross-react to BCNU.85 Macular erythema with tenderness may develop along body folds and may progress to benign telangiectasia.83 Bexarotene Gel. Bexarotene (Targretin) gel 1% is the newest topical therapy for CTCL. A synthetic reti.noid, bexarotene selectively activates retinoid X receptors (RXRs).86 As with other retinoids, the exact mechanism of action of bexarotene is unknown. Initial administration involves application once every other day with a gradual increase to application 2 to 4 times daily.86 Phase I-II trials involving 67 patients were conduct.ed at 3 study centers. The trials achieved an ORR of 63% and a CR of 21%.86 The projected median dura.tion of response was 428 days. Of the 67 patients, 12 with early-stage CTCL had received no prior therapy for CTCL. In this subset the ORR was 75% with a CR in 33%, and the median duration of response of 562 days.87 Adverse events were mild to moderate, occur.ring primarily at the site of application. These includ.ed erythema (73%), pruritus (33%), and pain (24%).86 In a subsequent multicenter, international, open-label clinical trial, 50 patients with stage IA-IIA CTCL who were intolerant to, were refractory to, or had per.sistent disease with at least 2 prior therapies were treated with topical bexarotene gel 1%, with increas.ing applications as tolerated. The patients achieved an ORR of 38% and a CR of 8%.88 Relapse occurred in 32% over a median duration of treatment of 165 days. Adverse effects included rash (72%), pruritus (32%), pain (22%), skin disorder or inflammation (16%), and irritant contact dermatitis (12%) at application sites.88 Phototherapy Data regarding phototherapy are shown in Table 6. Ultraviolet Light. Phototherapy with UV-B or UV-A (or both) is used in early disease. A possible protective role for UV radiation was proposed based on the ob.servation that CTCL presents most commonly on sun-protected areas of the body.89,90 An early study by Milstein et al89 determined the efficacy of home UV radiation (both UV-B and UV-A) in 31 patients with patch- or plaque-stage mycosis fun.goides. An ORR of 84% was obtained, with 61% CR and 23% PR. The median duration of response was 18 months. A 15-year follow-up study of the same patients reported a CR of 74% with a 51-month medi.an duration.91 CR was achieved more often in patch-stage than in plaque-stage mycosis fungoides, but the extent of skin involvement was not significant for obtaining CR (14/21 patients with <10% skin involve.ment vs 9/10 patients with >10% skin involvement).91 Long-term administration was well tolerated. Of note, 4 patients had BCC develop and 3 had actinic ker.atoses develop, but no SCC was reported.91 UV-B may serve an immunoregulatory role by de.creasing the alloactivating and antigen-presenting capacity of LangerhansÕ cells92 and increasing IL-193 and IL-6 production.94 In a retrospective study of 35 patients with patch or plaque mycosis fungoides who were treated with UV-B radiation, a CR of 83% and a PR of 5% (22-month median duration) was attained in stage T1 patients, whereas stage T2 patients did not respond to UV-B monotherapy.90 Overall, treatment was well tolerated with only pruritus reported rarely. Narrowband UV-B phototherapy has been in use for over 10 years and is more effective than broadband UV.B in psoriasis treatment95,96; however, its efficacy in mycosis fungoides has only recently been investigated. In an open study of 8 patients with stage IA or IB mycosis fungoides, a 100% ORR was achieved, with a 75% CR lasting a mean of 20 months.95 No correlation between skin phototype and therapeutic response was observed. Adverse effects include erythema and pruri.tus acutely and photoaging and the risk of photocar.cinogenesis chronically.96 Thus narrowband UV-B for mycosis fungoides treatment may yield similar results to broadband UV-B with less irradiation. UV-A1 (340-400 nm) induces apoptosis in cuta.neous helper T cells. It was found to be effective in stage I mycosis fungoides in a small study of 3 patients, in whom CR was 100% (3/3).97 High-dose (130 J/cm2) and medium-dose (60 J/cm2) regimens were evaluated, and improvement was found in both groups.97 No serious side effects have been reported. Although the study is limited, it suggests that UV-A1 may be an effective treatment for stage I mycosis fun.goides. Fair-skinned patients are reported to have a better response to UV radiation because heavy skin melani-TABLE 6.

PUVA therapy involves activation of ingested psoralen by UV-A irradiation, inducing DNA cross-links in cutaneous T cells with subsequent inhibition of DNA synthesis and mitosis. PUVA is administered 3 times weekly until skin clear.ance is achieved, then treatment is gradually decreased with maintenance lasting for up to 1 year. In 1979 Roenigk99 conducted a follow-up study of 38 patients with mycosis fungoides or SŽzary syndrome at several institutions. In the first group, disease re.sponse or clearance with maintenance PUVA therapy was reported in a follow-up over 3 years in 10 of 12 patients. One patient died, and one patient was lost to follow-up. Two patients received additional x-ray ther.apy for cutaneous tumors.99 In the second group the results of a 1-year follow-up on 7 patients with myco.sis fungoides and 5 with SŽzary syndrome were simi.lar, with an ORR of 86% and 40%, respectively.99 The initial results from the third group reported an ORR of 83% for 12 patients with mycosis fungoides and 100% for 2 patients with SŽzary syndrome.99 A long-term follow-up study by Herrmann et al100 involved 82 mycosis fungoides patients treated over 15 years. The patients had stages I-IV disease, with 83% stage IA or IB. An ORR of 95% and a CR in 65% with a 43-month mean duration of response were reported. Side effects were generally minimal and included pru.ritus, nausea, and signs of chronic actinic damage (lentigines, actinic keratoses, BCC, and SCC). The response rate and adverse effect profile compared favorably with those of other topical therapies.100 Briffa et al101 reported CRs of 100%, 93%, 44%, and 0% in 73 patients who had mycosis fungoides with stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively. They concluded that PUVA can achieve complete clinical and histolog.ic remission in stage I or II mycosis fungoides but is less effective with tumor-stage lesions. This failure may be attributed to the limited depth of penetration of UV-A.101 In addition, a follow-up study of 24 patients with patch or plaque mycosis fungoides who were treated with twice-weekly PUVA and adjuvant radiation ther.apy reported long periods of remission, up to 12 Curr Probl Dermatol, November/December 2001 years.102 Roupe et al102 determined that long disease-free periods after PUVA were a positive prognostic factor and proposed that PUVA therapy in early myco.sis fungoides may give long-term remission and delay extracutaneous spread. In 1994 Swanbeck et al103 evaluated the influence of PUVA therapy on the mortality rate in Sweden. They determined the mean yearly mortality rate from myco.sis fungoides to be 7.33 between 1961 and 1978 and 2.83 between 1979 and 1990. Prior to 1977, mycosis fungoides was primarily treated with radiotherapy in the tumor stage. After the introduction of PUVA, patients were treated at very early stages of disease.103 Thus the mortality rate was constant in the 15 to 20 years before PUVA introduction. With its introduction in the late 1970s, the mortality rate dropped significantly and then remained constant again.103 The authors concluded that PUVA treatment resulted in a considerable decrease in the mortality rate from mycosis fungoides.103 Pruritus, nausea, and chronic actinic damage are the primary adverse effects of PUVA therapy.100,101 PUVA is associated with the development of SCC, BCC, and possibly melanoma. A study of 82 patients who had mycosis fungoides with a 15-year follow-up reported 3 BCCs and 3 SCCs.100 Thus secondary cutaneous malignancies may limit the use of PUVA, but the ben.efits of therapy must also be considered. In addition, treatment expenditure may limit access to PUVA. Combination regimens involving PUVA may be use.ful after treatment failure or disease relapse. Interferon alfa combined with PUVA is an important example. Mostow et al104 studied the efficacy of this combina.tion. Patients self-administered daily subcutaneous injections of recombinant human interferon alfa for 2 weeks, followed by a 3 times-weekly course of PUVA therapy. Five patients with mycosis fungoides refrac.tory to PUVA monotherapy obtained a 100% CR in a mean of 3.2 months.104 In a larger study of 39 patients with CTCL who were treated with PUVA and interferon alfa, a CR of 62% and a PR of 28% with a median response duration of 28 months were achieved.105 These results were the summation of a successful phase I trial of 15 patients and a subsequent phase II trial of 24 patients. The median duration of survival for the entire cohort was 62 months.105 Overall, the therapy was relatively well tolerated with the overwhelming majority of adverse effects related to interferon injections. A multicenter study by Rupoli et al106 evaluated low-dose interferon alfa-2b and PUVA in 25 patients with stage I and II CTCL. After the induction phase, 36% achieved CR and 56% achieved PR. During the main.tenance phase, an ORR of 96% (76% CR and 20% PR) was attained.106 The 1- and 2-year probabilities of freedom from treatment failure were 82% and 62%, respectively.106 Retinoid plus PUVA therapy (RePUVA) achieves similar results to PUVA monotherapy.107 In an open study, PUVA monotherapy was administered to 47 patients with mycosis fungoides twice or 4 times weekly. RePUVA was given to 22 patients, with oral retinoids administered daily for 2 weeks before the ini.tiation of PUVA therapy. In the PUVA-treated patients, CR was 72% and PR was 28%. In the RePUVA-treat.ed patients, CR was 73% and PR was 27%.107 The relapse rate was the same in both groups. Furthermore, fewer PUVA sessions and lower UV-A doses may be required for remission with RePUVA.107 Extracorporeal Photopheresis. Photopheresis is a modification of PUVA in which the patientÕs circulat.ing mononuclear cells are directed through plastic tub.ing, exposed to psoralen and UV-A, and then returned to the patient. The most favorable results have been observed in patients with early erythrodermic CTCL.108 Treatment is given for 2 consecutive days a month for at least 6 months.109 CBC and platelet counts are mon.itored monthly. In 1987 Edelson et al110 reported a 73% ORR in 37 primarily erythrodermic patients who had CTCL with extracorporeal photopheresis (ECPP) therapy. Since then, subsequent studies have shown encouraging, though less impressive, results. In a trial of 34 patients with mycosis fungoides or SŽzary syndrome (stage I, III, or IV), CR was achieved in 18% and PR was achieved in 32%, with an ORR of 50%.109 Another ECPP study evaluating 20 patients with CTCL stages IB-IV yielded an ORR of 55%, with 25% CR and 30% PR.111 However, ECPP therapy in SŽzary syndrome has a low response rate. A study involving 44 patients with SŽzary syndrome found no significant difference (P = .12) in median survival in patients treated with the standard ECPP protocol versus other regimens.112 Although ECPP is favorable in erythrodermic CTCL, it has limited success in patch or plaque, tumor, or advanced disease.108 Since the open trial of Edelson et al,110 subsequent reports have been retrospective stud.ies of all stages of patients with CTCL who underwent different protocols of ECPP. Such observations high.light the complexity of evaluation. Gziemski et al113 evaluated the efficacy and safety of ECPP in a small TABLE 7.

They proposed that study complexity was attributable to lack of reproducibility of skin score assessment, a critical marker in determining response, among individual observers. In addition, they deter.mined that LDH did not correlate with skin scores dur.ing progressive treatment, SŽzary cell count changes are of doubtful prognostic significance, adenopathy is associated with a worse prognosis, and increased expression of cellular activation markers was associated with clinical improvement only.113 Subsequent trials have determined that ECPP directly induces apoptosis,114 induces increased tumor necrosis factor . production by monocytes,115 and is associat.ed with decreased peripheral CD4+ T lymphocytes.116 Adverse effects are minor and include low-grade fever with or without chills for 24 hours after treat.ment, headache, nausea, transient increased erythema, acral edema, and hypovolemic hypotension.108-116 Peri.pheral venous access is challenging in some patients. Another consideration is the expense of treatment. Photodynamic Therapy. Hypericin, a photodynamic compound activated by visible or UV-A light, inhibits neoplastic cells through induction of apoptosis. In vitro analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from control (normal cells and Epstein-Barr virusÐ transformed lymphocytes) and malignant CTCL cells has shown near-complete apoptosis (94%) in malig.nant CTCL cells versus 37% to 88% in control cells upon activation with either visible or UV-A light.117 Although studies in human beings have not been per.formed, hypericin may prove to be a useful treatment for CTCL. Radiation Therapy Data regarding radiation therapy are shown in Table 7. Local Superficial Radiotherapy. Local superficial radiotherapy uses local electron beam irradiation for unilesional or limited stage IA mycosis fungoides. CR is reported at 97% to 100%, with a 10-year disease-free survival at 64% to 86% and 10-year survival at 100%.118,119 Minimal adverse effects included moder.ate erythema, mild atrophy, and dryness, but no sys.temic effects were reported.119 Total Skin Electron Beam Therapy. Total skin elec.tron beam therapy (TSEBT) involves irradiating the entire skin surface with multiple electron fields gener.ated from linear accelerators. A typical regimen is 6.MeV electrons given 4 times per week for a total of 3600 cGy in 10 weeks.108 Response is related to the disease stage. A Stanford University study of 226 patients with stage T1-T4 mycosis fungoides achieved CR in 98% for stage T1, 71% for T2, 38% for T3, and 53% for T4.2 TSEBT can be effective monotherapy for erythrodermic CTCL and is most effective in those with no blood involvement.120 Although the response rate is high and overall patient survival is favorable after TSEBT treatment, many responders will relapse within 5 years of treatment.121 Freedom from relapse after TSEBT is 15% to 50% for 10 years.2,121 A large retrospective study from Stanford University evaluated the use of topical HN2 versus TSEBT for 122 patients with limited patch or plaque disease. Patients treated with TSEBT had a higher CR rate than those treated with topical HN2 (97% and 68%, respectively).122 They also had a more favorable freedom-from-relapse outcome (10-year freedom from relapse, 58.7% for patients treated with TSEBT and 45% for those treat.ed with topical HN2). Despite the differences in CR and freedom from relapse, the 2 treatment groups had similar long-term overall survival and disease-free outcome. Curr Probl Dermatol, November/December 2001 Adverse effects of TSEBT commonly include alope.cia, skin erythema, moist and dry skin desquamation, nail dystrophy, and extremity edema.108,123 Chronic effects are mild skin atrophy, telangiectasia, BCC or SCC, and melanoma.123-125 Reddy et al123 evaluated the dose-response relation.ship in 49 patients with mycosis fungoides stages I-IV irradiated with either less than 2000 cGy (group I) or greater than 2000 cGy (group II) and found no statis.tically significant difference between the groups. Group I had a CR of 72% with a median duration of 27 months, and group II had a CR of 77.4% with a median duration of 35.3 months.123 Another study evaluated the efficacy of TSEBT administered once weekly versus standard multidos.ing. Initial CR was achieved in 100% of 137 patients treated with once-weekly TSEBT with a median 9.month remission.126 Unfavorable prognosis was asso.ciated with erythroderma and the presence of SŽzary cells.126 Additional courses of TSEBT for treatment of recur.rent CTCL are effective in patients with widely dis.seminated or refractory disease. In a trial of 14 patients with T2 to T4 disease previously treated with a course of TSEBT, CR was obtained in 86% with a median duration of 11.5 months. Five patients received a third course of TSEBT, and an ORR of 100% (60% CR and 40% PR) was observed.124 In addition, no hematolog.ic toxicity was appreciated. Adverse effects were con.sistent with those seen in patients treated with TSEBT for the first time in both the acute and the chronic set.tings.124 Another retrospective study determined that additional courses of TSEBT are effective with a 100% ORR (duration of 2-40 months) and are gener.ally well tolerated.127 The criteria for undergoing a second course of TSEBT included (1) favorable response to first course of TSEBT, (2) long period of remission after first course, (3) prolonged interval between subsequent treatment, (4) recurrent general.ized skin disease, and (5) exhaustion of other treat.ment modalities.127 TSEBT may also be effective for relapsed CTCL after topical or systemic chemotherapy. A retrospec.tive analysis of 66 patients with all stages of mycosis fungoides yielded 100% CR in stage A (superficial lesions covering <50% of body surface), 44% CR in stage B (lesions covering >50% body surface), and 39% CR in stage C (tumors of skin, lymph nodes, or viscera).128 Freedom from relapse at 1 year was 68% for stage A, 58% for stage B, and 23% for stage C. Adverse effects were similar to those seen with first-time TSEBT treatment.128 The use of systemic chemotherapy or ECPP after TSEBT may improve the survival rate. A study of 163 patients who achieved CR with TSEBT evaluated the efficacy of adjuvant therapy in relapse-free and overall survival. Three- to five-year survival was 70% to 75% for T3 and T4 patients treated with combination doxo.rubicin and cyclophosphamide or ECPP compared with 30% for similar patients without additional treatment.129 There was no impact on relapse-free survival for all T stages treated with systemic adjuvant therapies.129 TSEBT with adjuvant topical HN2 may be effective for the initial treatment of plaque- or tumor-stage my.cosis fungoides. A retrospective analysis of 109 patients by Chinn et al130 concluded that TSEBT yields signif.icantly higher CR rates than HN2 monotherapy (76% vs 39%, respectively). Thus, for T2 or T3 disease, Chinn et al recommend adjuvant HN2 administration after CR from TSEBT is obtained.130 An earlier study evaluating adjuvant topical mechlorethamine after TSEBT determined that projected relapse-free survival is higher in the adjuvant group (37%) than in the TSEBT monotherapy group (29%).131 In that study the median duration to relapse was 25 months with adju.vant HN2 versus 17 months with TSEBT alone. The efficacy of TSEBT combined with total-body x-ray irradiation (TBI) has been assessed for advanced mycosis fungoides. Twelve patients were treated with TBI followed by TSEBT and a second course of TBI. With CR of 75% and PR of 25%, this method did not increase CR rates or prolong relapse-free survival in comparison with TSEBT monotherapy.132 Single-Agent Systemic Therapy Data regarding systemic monotherapy are shown in Table 8. Retinoids. Retinoids are synthetic vitamin A deriva.tives with antiproliferative and antineoplastic activi.ty.133 Vitamin A is an important regulator of epithelial tissue growth and differentiation,134 but the mecha.nism of action remains incompletely understood.135 Retinoids may act as adjuvants in the induction of a TH1 cytokine response by synergizing with IL-2 in the production of IFN-. and IL-12 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a dose-dependent response.136 They may also inhibit growth of a malignant T-cell clone.136 Isotretinoin, etretinate, arotinoids, acitretin (Soriatane), and bexarotene have been used both as monotherapy and in combination regimens.

The ORR was 44% with 12% achieving CR for a median duration of 8 months.139 Common side effects included dryness of the skin and mucous mem.branes.139 Kessler et al139 concluded that retinoid ther.apy may be an effective and relatively nontoxic alter.native for patients who relapse after electron beam irradiation, topical HN2, PUVA, or other standard treatment regimens. An earlier study by Claudy et al142 examined the efficacy of oral etretinate therapy. Six patients with stage IB-III CTCL were administered daily etretinate doses for 2 to 14 months with no additional therapy. CR was obtained in 83%. For patients who discontin.ued treatment after initial skin clearing, recurrence occurred in 3 to 4 months. Adverse effects included mild cheilitis, dryness of the nasal mucosa, and xero.sis. Thus the authors proposed that retinoids may act as an adjuvant for inducing cytotoxic cells and in the regulation of T-cell interaction with the epidermis.142 Molin et al135 compared the efficacy of isotretinoin and etretinate in 65 CTCL patients. Within 2 months of isotretinoin therapy, CR was obtained in 21% of 39 patients and PR in 38%. Etretinate therapy induced CR in 21% of 24 patients and PR in 46%.135 With continued treatment after initial skin clearing, 5 isotretinoin-treat.ed patients and 3 etretinate-treated patients remained in complete remission for 5 to 20 months, whereas the majority remained in partial remission. It was conclud.ed that both retinoids are of equal potency in the treat.ment of plaque- and tumor-stage mycosis fungoides.135 A polyaromatic retinoid, arotinoid-ethylester (Ro.13-6298), is a third-generation retinoid with higher antiproliferative activity than first- and second-genera.tion retinoids.134,143 In a pilot study of 6 patients with refractory CTCL, Ro-13-6298 yielded CR in 1 patient with a duration of more than 102 weeks and PR in 2 patients with a 43-week mean duration of response.143 Adverse effects included mucocutaneous dryness, skin atrophy, and skin desquamation. Bexarotene. Bexarotene, the newest synthetic retinoid, selectively activates RXRs involved in gene expression.137 The RXRs function as transcription fac.tors that regulate cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Oral bexarotene was evaluated in a phase II-III, ran.domized, multicenter trial for the treatment of refrac.tory or persistent early-stage CTCL.137 Fifty-eight patients with stage IA-IIA CTCL who were refractory or intolerant to at least 2 prior therapies were given daily oral bexarotene for at least 4 weeks. An ORR of 48% and a CR of 12% were achieved.137 Response duration at the optimal dose of 300 mg/m2 was 120 to 210 days, and 13% of responders relapsed. Adverse events included hyperlipemia (71%), hypercholestero.lemia (36%), headache (36%), hypothyroidism (29%), leukopenia (18%), pruritus (18%), and nausea (18%).137 Another multicenter, open-label trial studied the effi.cacy of oral bexarotene in patients with refractory advanced-stage CTCL. Ninety-four patients with stage IIB-IVB CTCL who were refractory to a median of 3.5 prior therapies were administered 650 mg/m2 and a reduced dose of 300 mg/m2.138 The ORR was 49%, with response rates of 57% at IIB, 32% at III, 44% at IVA, and 40% at IVB.138 In addition, a CR of 6% was attained in this refractory group. The median duration of response was 299 days, and 36% of responders relapsed.138 Adverse effects were reported as hyper.lipemia, hypercholesterolemia, central hypothyroid.ism, headache, asthenia, pruritus, leukopenia, and rash or skin disorder.138 Oral bexarotene may also be effective therapy for erythrodermic CTCL. A multicenter phase II-III study evaluated 9 erythrodermic CTCL patients taking daily oral bexarotene.140 The patients had been refractory to prior therapy with interferon, ECPP, PUVA, TSEBT, and oral or systemic chemotherapy. All 9 patients had greater than 70% clearing of cutaneous involvement after 12 weeks of therapy.140 By 28 weeks, 2 patients achieved CR and the other 7 achieved stable PR. No serious adverse effects were observed.140 Oral bexarotene stimulates RXR-responsive genes to alter cytokines responsible for the maintenance and proliferation of malignant T cells. Thus the possibility that this alteration might reduce cutaneous homing of CTCL cells and lead to an increase of circulating cells and lymphoma dissemination was evaluated by Hymes et al.144 The cases of 8 patients from the phase II-III trials of oral bexarotene therapy in early- and advanced-stage CTCL were followed with additional studies for a mean of 6.6 months. Serial measurements of circulating CD3+CD4+ peripheral blood lympho.cytes were taken, and molecular studies of T-cell receptor clonality were documented.144 The ORR in these patients was 50%, consistent with the phase II.III study population. In addition, a review of absolute CD4 and CD8 cell counts of 152 patients enrolled in the phase II-III trials was performed. The median absolute CD4 count decreased from 656/mL to 571/mL during a greater than 16-week observation.144 It was concluded that oral bexarotene does not increase the relative or absolute circulating CD4 cell count or the dissemination of malignant cells.144 Most adverse effects are dose dependent and include hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and decreased HDL levels.128,137,140,145 Central hypothyroidism may develop in bexarotene-treated patients, as the RXR ligand may suppress thyrotropin secretion.146,147 Bexarotene is metabolized by the cytochrome p450 3A4 isozyme, which can be com.petitively inhibited by azole antifungals, erythro.mycin, grapefruit juice, and gemfibrozil.145,148 Purine Analogs 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine. 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA, Cladribine) is a purine analog resistant to adenosine deaminase degradation. Its derivatives accu.mulate in lymphocytes independent of cell division149 and mediate DNA strand breakage and cell death.150 A phase I study concluded that 2-CdA (0.09 mg/kg/d) was safe with monitoring for myelosuppression and hypovolemia.150 A pilot study by Saven et al151 in.volved 15 patients with CTCL who were administered 2-CdA 0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg/d intravenously for 7 days at 4-week intervals until maximal response was achieved or serious toxicity was encountered. An ORR of 47% (CR in 20% and PR in 27%) was obtained, with a 5-month median duration of remission.151 Overall, therapy was well tolerated. Myelosuppression was the most common adverse effect, encountered in 53% of patients.151 A subsequent study of 22 patients with mature T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders involved a similar regi.men of intravenous 2-CdA. Of the 8 patients with mycosis fungoides, 1 achieved CR.152 Adverse effects were primarily related to myelosuppression, and non-hematologic toxicity was minimal.152 A larger trial involving 21 patients with relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides or SŽzary syndrome achieved an ORR of 28% (CR 14% with median dura.tion of 4.5 months and PR 14% with median duration of 2 months).153 It was concluded that 2-CdA may be therapeutic even in patients in whom numerous prior treatments had failed.153 Side effects included bone marrow suppression and infection.152,153 2«Deoxycoformycin. 2«Deoxycoformycin (dCF, Pentostatin), a potent inhibitor of adenosine deami.nase, has also been evaluated as monotherapy for CTCL treatment. Overall efficacy in advanced mycosis fun.goides and SŽzary syndrome has been reported from 23% to 100%.154-158 Adverse effects were mild and included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, infection, fever, rash, and headache.154,156,158 Occasional neutropenia was observed. A phase I study evaluated the efficacy of dCF in 4 patients with advanced mycosis fungoides at doses with acceptable toxicity. Two attained CR for more than 7 months, and two had PR for 4 and 9 months, respectively.158 Toxicity included reversible renal insufficiency (25%) and reversible myelosuppression (75%).158 Phase II trials reported similar results among the studies. Cummings et al157 treated 37 patients with re.fractory lymphoma or CTCL in an Eastern Coopera.tive Oncology Group Trial. Of 8 patients with CTCL, 4 achieved a PR with a response duration of 0.6 to 53.4 months. From this study, dCF was determined to be active in CTCL therapy and may be useful in combi.nation chemotherapy regimens.157 An EORTC phase II trial evaluated 76 patients with progressive and advanced T-cell malignancies, of whom 26 had SŽzary syndrome and 22 had mycosis fungoides. The ORR was 33% for SŽzary syndrome (disease-free survival, 25 weeks) and 23% for mycosis fungoides (disease.free survival, 44 weeks).154 Because dCF exerts rela.tively specific lymphocytic effects and has a favorable toxicity profile, it may be a useful palliative treatment for T-cell malignancies.154 A phase II study by Foss et al156 evaluated the effi.cacy and toxicity of alternating the administration of deoxycoformin and interferon alfa-2a in patients with advanced or refractory CTCL. Forty-one patients were given intravenous dCF on days 1 through 3 and then intramuscular interferon on days 22 to 26. An ORR of 44% was achieved, with 5% attaining CR.156 Progression-free survival of responders was 13 months. Overall, 39% of patients reported interferon-related constitutional symptoms. Severe toxicities included cardiomyopathy (2%), acute and chronic pul.monary dysfunction (10%), and reversible mental sta.tus change (5%).156 Methotrexate. Low-dose methotrexate is used as sin.gle-agent chemotherapy for CTCL. A folate analog, methotrexate inhibits DNA synthesis by blocking the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate required for the production of purines and pyrimidines. It has been reported to be successful both in patch or plaque159 and in erythrodermic CTCL. Methotrexate is administered as a once-weekly dose given orally or as an intramuscular injection. A retrospective study evaluating low-dose metho-Curr Probl Dermatol, November/December 2001 trexate treatment in 29 erythrodermic CTCL patients with a 129-month follow-up cited a 58% ORR (41% CR and 17% PR) with a 31-month freedom from treat.ment failure and a median survival of 8.4 years.160 Adverse effects included reversible elevated serum aminotransferase, reversible leukopenia, mucositis, cutaneous erosions, nausea, diarrhea, and malaise.160 Methotrexate has synergistic effects with both leu.covorin rescue and fluorouracil. Leucovorin selectively rescues normal tissue from methotrexate-induced intracellular folate deficiency.161 Fluorouracil, a pyrimidine analog, incorporates into RNA and inhibits DNA synthesis.161 Synergism of methotrexate and flu.orouracil results from enhanced fluorouracil incorpo.ration into and fragmentation of DNA.161 An open trial evaluating methotrexate and fluorouracil with leucov.orin rescue reported 80% clearing in 8 of 10 patients with mycosis fungoides and SŽzary syndrome and 60% clearing in the remaining 2 patients; the mean survival for all stages was 5.18 years.161 The combina.tion treatment was well tolerated with mild anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and mucositis. Evidence of myelo.suppression was seen in only 1 patient.161 Others Chlorambucil. Chlorambucil is a derivative of HN2 containing an amino acid group designed to target active cells with an increasing demand for nutrients while minimizing the effects on normal tissues.162 Chlorambucil exerts its cytotoxic effects by covalently linking alkyl groups to DNA.162 It has been used as a single agent and in combination chemotherapy. A Yale University study of single-agent, high-dose pulse chlorambucil (pCBL) involved 33 patients with advanced, low-grade non-HodgkinÕs lymphoma.163,164 Patients were given an oral dose of pCBL daily for 5 consecutive days per month. Initial response rates were favorable, with an ORR of 91%, CR of 78%, and no relapses during a 35-month median follow-up.163 Responding patients received pCBL for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 24 months. With a sub.sequent 4-year median follow-up, the ORR was 70%, CR was 33%, and disease-free survival was 28 months.164 Adverse effects included minimal hemato.logic toxicity, drug-induced premature menopause, and second neoplasms. Chlorambucil has been used in combination chemo.therapy for CTCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The combination of pCBL and prednisone is an effec.tive treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.165 Chlorambucil may be combined with prednisone or fluocortolone for the treatment of erythrodermic CTCL. Introduced in 1974, the Winkelmann regimen involves daily administration of chlorambucil and prednisone.165a In a study of 40 patients with SŽzary syndrome, therapy with this combination increased the median survival of erythrodermic patients to 6.2 years versus 3.05 years for patients undergoing therapy with other regimens.166 The adverse effect of this regimen was temporary leukopenia. Sepsis was attributed to progressive disease, as it occurred equally in both treatment groups.166 Another regimen, described by Coors and von den Driesch,167 incorporated chlorambucil and fluocor.tolone, having the same potency as prednisone without a mineralocorticoid effect. The combination was ad.ministered to 13 erythrodermic CTCL patients and achieved ORR of 100%, with CR in 54% and a 16.5.month mean duration of remission.167 This method was estimated to decrease total dosages of both drugs by greater than 50% when compared with the Winkel.mann scheme. Thus treatment was well tolerated with no severe or treatment-limiting side effects.167 Adverse effects from chlorambucil have also been reported with treatment of leukemia and lymphoma. The most common acute toxicity is myelosuppres.sion.168 Rare cases of significant cutaneous eruptions, seizures, and myoclonus have also been reported.168-170 Cyclosporine. A neutral hydrophobic cyclic peptide of fungal origin, cyclosporine is a powerful immuno.suppressive agent.171 It reduces the transcription of cytokines, especially IL-2, thought to mediate T-cell expansion.172,173 Patients with CTCL who were treated with daily oral doses of cyclosporine did not achieve complete remission; however, partial remission with very brief duration has been reported in 12.5% to 100%.171,174 Adverse reactions include significant renal toxicity, severe hypertension, infection, and diar.rhea.171,174 Cyclosporine monotherapy is not sufficient for any stage of CTCL. A phase II study of cyclosporine therapy was con.ducted on 16 patients with refractory T-cell lymphomas. Cyclosporin A (CSA) was orally administered twice daily, and patients were regularly followed up for dis.ease response and toxicity.174 Of the 11 patients with CTCL, 18% achieved a CR.174 Within 1 week of dis.continuing therapy, both responders had recurrent dis.ease approaching baseline levels. Furthermore, many patients were removed from the study because of dis.ease progression or significant renal toxicity. The authors concluded that the poor response of refractory CTCL to CSA may be attributed to a lack of IL-2 dependence or the inability of CSA to reach its intra.cellular target.174 A smaller study of CSA therapy involved 3 patients with mycosis fungoides and 2 with SŽzary syndrome.171 Those with mycosis fungoides had mild, transient improvement of disease. One patient with SŽzary syn.drome showed significant improvement over 2 years of CSA therapy. Thus, whereas cyclosporine mono-therapy may not be effective, lower doses in addition to other immunomodulators may achieve longer last.ing improvement while minimizing potential adverse reactions.171 Doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline often used in combination systemic chemotherapy. Doxoru.bicin acts through topoisomerase II inhibition, interca.lating between adjacent DNA base pairs.175 It has been used in the treatment of lymphoma, myeloma, acute leukemia, and some solid tumors.175 Doxorubicin therapy in non-HodgkinÕs lymphoma has been particularly successful in combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP).176 CHOP therapy has been less effective in the treatment of CTCL patients, consistent with other combination systemic chemotherapy regimens report.ed in the literature.177 A follow-up study of 81 patients treated with either CHOP or COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone) involved 35 patients with stage IIB-IV CTCL.177 COP was administered to 27 patients, and CHOP was given to 8 patients. In the patients with CTCL, the ORR was 40% and 23% achieved CR.177 The median duration of response was 5.7 months, and median survival was 19 months. Adverse effects predominantly included myelosup.pression, granulocytopenia, alopecia, and nausea or vomiting.177 It was concluded that neither COP nor CHOP was satisfactory as first-line therapy for CTCL.177 Another study concluded that the addition of doxo.rubicin in combination chemotherapy may not alter CR or overall survival. A multicenter clinical trial by Lepage et al178 evaluated the efficacy of a PCOP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and pred.nisone) regimen associated by randomization with doxorubicin (PACOP). One hundred thirteen patients with de novo low-grade non-HodgkinÕs lymphoma, stage III or IV non-HodgkinÕs lymphoma, or stage II non-HodgkinÕs lymphoma with bulky disease were randomly assigned to an induction regimen of PCOP or PACOP for 6 cycles. They were then randomized to maintenance therapy with chlorambucil or CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone) for 12 monthly courses.178 CR was obtained in 45%, with 27% achieving CR after induction and 19% achieving CR during maintenance therapy. The median time to progression was estimated at 39 months. There was no significant difference in the CR of patients treated by PCOP and PACOP induction (43% and 47%, respec.tively) or chlorambucil and CVP maintenance (45% and 50%, respectively).178 Liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin delivers the drug to target tumor sites with reduced toxicity and higher efficacy.179 Liposomal doxorubicin has been efficacious in the treatment of refractory ovarian can.cer, advanced breast cancer, and acquired immunode.ficiencyÐrelated KaposiÕs sarcoma.180-182 Use of lipo.somal doxorubicin as monotherapy in CTCL has been promising, with an ORR of 83% in a pilot study of 6 patients with stage IB or IIB mycosis fungoides.179 Common adverse effects include mild anemia and lymphopenia.179 Caution must be used because doxo.rubicin has been associated with irreversible car.diomyopathy leading to congestive heart failure. Etoposide. Etoposide is a semisynthetic glucosidic derivative of podophyllotoxin used as a single agent or in combination systemic chemotherapy. Etoposide is routinely used as first-line combination chemotherapy for non-HodgkinÕs lymphoma, small-cell lung cancer, testicular cancer, and poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary site.183 The major mechanism of action of etoposide involves the binding to and inhibi.tion of DNA topoisomerase II.183,184 Etoposide re.versibly binds to topoisomerase II; thus longer etopo.side exposure results in longer enzyme inhibition.183,185 Etoposide use as single-agent therapy in refractory non-HodgkinÕs lymphoma has been effective, with response rates ranging from 35% to 65%.185-187 Hains.worth et al187 treated 25 patients who had refractory lymphoma with oral etoposide and achieved PR in 15 (60%) with a median time to disease progression of 5 months. Another study involved long-term daily ad.ministration of oral etoposide to 29 patients aged 65 years or older with refractory non-HodgkinÕs lym.phoma. An ORR of 65.5% was achieved, with a CR of 20.7% and a PR of 44.8% (median disease-free sur.vival, 15 months).185 In these studies, adverse effects included mild to severe leukopenia, anemia, thrombo.cytopenia, nausea, and vomiting.185,187 Etoposide is usually included in treatments for re.lapsed or refractory non-HodgkinÕs lymphoma.

ORRs range from 38% to 87%.188-192 Etoposide has been incorporated in first-line combi.nation regimens designed specifically for elderly patients. Results are similar to other standard regi.mens, with response rates of 56% to 90%.193-195 Etoposide use in elderly patients has been promising because of good response, low incidence of serious adverse effects, and subjective tolerance.185 Utilization of etoposide in aggressive non-HodgkinÕs lymphoma combination regimens such as ProMACE/ CytaBOM, MACOP-B, and CHOP-E has limited practicality.196,197 These regimens have been shown to be equivalent in efficacy to the standard CHOP regi.men and are more toxic.197,198 Somatostatin Analogs. As malignant lymphocytes from non-HodgkinÕs lymphomas express somatostatin receptors on their cell surfaces,199 somatostatin ana.logs may possess therapeutic activity in CTCL. Although the mechanism of action is unknown, somatostatin may inhibit growth factors regulating malignant lymphocytes, inhibit angiogenesis, or have direct antimitotic activity.200 A phase II trial evaluating subcutaneous administration of somatostatin in 9 patients with CTCL demonstrated a 44% partial remis.sion with median time to progression of 2.9 months and no complete remission.201 Hematologic toxicity was not observed. The most common side effects were diarrhea and hyperglycemia.201 Combination Systemic Therapy Numerous combination chemotherapy regimens have been investigated for the treatment of advanced mycosis fungoides. ORRs range from 60% to 100% with CR in 0% to 80%.202-210 The mean duration of response ranges from 2 months to more than 105 months. Individual trials are listed in Table 9. A randomized prospective clinical trial conducted at the National Cancer Institute com.pared aggressive therapy (TSEBT and cyclophos.phamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, and vincristine) with conservative therapy (HN2 or PUVA) as initial treatment. Aggressive therapy achieved an ORR of 90% and CR of 38%, whereas the conservative therapy achieved an ORR of 65% and CR of 18%, but there was no statisti.cal difference in long-term survival.211 Serious adverse effects include bone marrow depression, liver and renal toxicity, neurotoxicity, pulmonary fibrosis, and infec.tion. Alopecia, nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, pruritus, and skin desquamation may also occur. Combination sys.temic chemotherapy is reserved for advanced disease. Although the initial response may be high, relapse inevitably occurs, and adverse effects, specifically severe lymphopenia, can limit further treatment. Immunotherapy Data regarding immunotherapy are shown in Table 10. Monoclonal Antibodies.

Initial trials used unconjugated antibodies that required host immune effector cell recruitment to reach their target sites.212,213 In 1981 Miller and Levy214 reported 2 cases of thera.peutic response to the murine MoAb hybridoma L17F12, which targets the cell-surface glycoprotein Leu-1. Although CR was not achieved, a reduction in circulating targeted T cells was observed after each treatment, and antigenic modulation development was fully reversible.214 Dillman et al215 conducted an early pilot study of T101 MoAb, an anti-CD5 murine antibody. All 4 patients with CTCL who were treated with T101 had a substantial decline in circulating target cells, and 2 (50%) achieved PR. However, both relapsed within 3 weeks. Toxicity included fever, chills, and malaise and one anaphylactoid response.215 A subsequent study of T101 involved 8 patients with CTCL, and one PR with a 3-month duration was observed.216 Pruritus, hives, flushing, and shortness of breath were common adverse reactions. Serious adverse reactions included supraventricular arrhythmias and blood pressure insta.bility.216 In both studies, antimouse antibody develop.ment rendered further therapy ineffective. Overall, MoAb T101 is specific but of limited efficacy. Chimeric M-T412 MoAb is an anti-CD4 MoAb.217 In a phase I trial, 50, 100, or 200 mg of chimeric M.T412 MoAb was intravenously administered to 8 patients who had mycosis fungoides with an overall success rate of 88% and a mean freedom from progres.sion of 25 weeks. Fatigue, myalgia, headache, nausea, chills, fever, and local skin reactions were associated with therapy.217 Anti-CD52 (CAMPATH-1H) targets the CD52 anti.gen present on T and B lymphocytes.218 A phase II trial involving 50 patients with non-HodgkinÕs lym.phoma who were treated with 30 mg of anti-CD52 intravenously 3 times weekly for up to 12 weeks yielded CR in 2 and PR in 2 of 8 total patients with mycosis fungoides with a mean duration of 10 months.218 The adverse reaction related to anti-CD52 treatment was infection, and lymphopenia was observed in all 50 patients.218 Interferons. Interferons, designated ., ., or ., func.tion as cytokines. Produced by leukocytes,219 IFN-. binds to the type I interferon receptor, which then is rapidly phosphorylated and in turn phosphorylates 3 Curr Probl Dermatol, November/December 2001 STAT proteins involved in gene transcription.220 Furthermore, an absence of STAT1 expression is asso.ciated with CTCL resistance to IFN-..221 IFN-. has been used in the treatment for hematopoietic malig.nancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, non-HodgkinÕs lymphoma, HodgkinÕs disease, essen.tial thrombocytopenia, multiple myeloma, and myco.sis fungoides or SŽzary syndrome.222 IFN-. is administered either subcutaneously or intra.muscularly. ORRs are from 29% to 79% with a mean duration of 8 to 23 months.223,224 Adverse effects in.clude reversible leukopenia or thrombocytopenia and fatigue.224 Occasional moderate renal, hepatic, and central nervous system toxicity has been reported.223 Interferon has been associated with the development of autoimmune side effects225; interferon-induced acrocyanosis has also been reported.226 Interferon alfa use in combination with PUVA or retinoids may be effective for advanced or refractory CTCL. As discussed previously, combined interferon.alfa and PUVA therapy has achieved CR rates of 62% to 100%.104-106 Interferon-alfa and systemic retinoid combination therapy has been less successful. A pilot study evaluating interferon-alfa in combination with a retinoid (13-cis-retinoic acid) observed an ORR of 57% in 7 patients with CTCL.227 Patients on 50% dose-reduction maintenance therapy had no relapses during a 15-month observation.227 Another study assessed interferon-alfa monotherapy versus interferon-alfa and etretinate combination therapy in 45 patients with CTCL. CR or PR was obtained in 17 of 45 patients receiving interferon-alfa monotherapy and in an addi.tional 11 patients when etretinate was added.228 Sub.sequently, Stadler et al229 conducted a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial comparing inter.feron-alfa plus acitretin versus interferon-alfa plus PUVA in 82 patients with stage I and II CTCL. In the interferon plus PUVA group, CR was obtained in 70% versus CR in 38% of the interferon plus acitretin group. Time to response was also shorter in the inter.feron plus PUVA group at 19 weeks compared with 22 weeks in the interferon plus acitretin group. Overall, side effects were mild to moderate in both groups. Combination interferon alfa and ECPP therapy may be effective for advanced CTCL. Rook et al230 de.scribed marked improvement in a patient with rapidly advancing SŽzary syndrome who was receiving com.bination interferon-alfa and photopheresis. Another study involved 28 patients with advanced-stage CTCL who were treated with ECPP initially. Nine of the patients (initial responses, 4 CR, 4 PR, and 1 no re.sponse) subsequently received combination therapy with interferon-alfa and, in some cases, other agents, and 5 had an enhanced response to combination thera.py.231 Dippel et al232 reported a study comparing ECPP monotherapy with combination ECPP and inter.feron-alfa therapy in 19 patients with advanced-stage CTCL. The 9 combination therapy patients had a bet.ter clinical response, with 4 CR and 2 PR, when com.pared with the ECPP monotherapy patients, with one CR. Vonderheid et al233 evaluated the utility of ECPP and interferon-alfa in a pilot study of 6 patients with SŽzary syndrome and concluded that the combination therapy was not effective. In a prospective unpublished trial of 20 stage I-IV CTCL patients, 1 CR and 3 PR were attained in 11 patients on interferon monotherapy compared with 2 PR in 9 patients on combination interferon and ECPP.234 The different responses observed in these studies demonstrate the need for a prospective, randomized trial evaluating interferon monotherapy, ECPP monotherapy, and interferon plus ECPP combination therapy. IFN-., synthesized by T cells, is used for treatment of tumor-stage mycosis fungoides. Its mechanism of action is unknown, but it has been hypothesized that it induces tumor regression by affecting cytokine gene expression in mycosis fungoides tumor lesions.235 A phase I trial of recombinant IFN-. (rIFN-.) determined that the maximal tolerated dose of intramuscular rIFN.. is 0.5 mg/m2.236 mRNA expression of IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 was significantly decreased and IL-2 mRNA was mildly induced after responsive IFN-. treatment in a patient with mycosis fungoides.235 In a phase II trial of 16 patients with CTCL, Kaplan et al237 demonstrated the potential efficacy of rIFN-. treatment. PR was observed in 31% with a median 10-month duration, and a minor response was observed in 38%. Adverse reactions included fever, weight loss, mild neutropenia, elevated LDH, and elevated hepatic transaminase lev.els. Nephrotic syndrome developed in one patient. IL-2 Fusion Toxin. Mycosis fungoides or SŽzary syndrome cells may express high-affinity IL-2 recep.tors (CD25) on their cell membranes. IL-2 fusion tox.ins have been developed to target these cells and to deliver cytotoxins. The first fusion protein to be stud.ied, DAB486IL-2, is composed of 486 amino acids of diphtheria toxin fused to IL-2.238 Phase II trials of DAB486IL-2 therapy in 36 patients with CTCL yielded 17% ORR and 3% CR.239 Denileukin diftitox (ONTAK), a redesigned fusion protein DAB389IL-2, has improved success. A multicen.ter phase I study of DAB389IL-2 involved 35 patients with CTCL, 17 with non-HodgkinÕs lymphoma, and 21 with HodgkinÕs disease.240,241 Among those with CTCL, an ORR of 37% (ORR stage I 63%, stage II 60%, stage III 29%, stage IV 0%) and CR of 14% were reported.240 The mean duration of response was 15 months for complete responders and 3 months for par.tial responders.240 A phase III study evaluated 2 dose levels of ONTAK in 71 patients with CTCL. Either 9 or 18 µg/kg/d was administered 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles total.242 The patients had stage IB-III CTCL, in whom 4 or more prior treatments had failed, or stage IVA CTCL, in whom at least 1 pre.vious therapy had failed. The ORR was 30% (23% for the 9-µg/kg/d arm and 36% for the 18-µg/kg/d arm), and the CR was 10%.242 The median duration of response was 6.9 months. Patients who responded to ONTAK therapy showed significant improvement in quality of life, pruritus relief, and global skin scores.243 There was no significant difference in ORR, CR, or median duration of response between the 2 dose arms. Likewise, tolerability of the 2 doses was similar, although an increased incidence of hypoalbuminemia or hypotension was observed at the higher dose.242 Reversible reactions of the IL-2 fusion toxins in.clude hypoalbuminemia, elevated liver transaminase levels, anemia, and minor elevated serum creatinine levels.238 Other adverse effects include fever, chills, hypotension, nausea, edema, sepsis, and vascular leak syndrome.238,240,242 A study by Shao et al244 assessed the impact of the combination of steroid and ONTAK therapy on re.sponse and tolerability. Twenty patients with CTCL, 10 with stage III/IV disease, were treated with either dexamethasone or prednisone in combination with ONTAK. The ORR was 60%, with 15% achieving CR.244 This response rate was significantly higher than that of the previous phase III trial of ONTAK mono-therapy. Infusion-related adverse events were signifi.cantly decreased, but the incidence of vascular leak syndrome did not change. It was concluded that the combination of steroids and ONTAK significantly improved clinical response and tolerability compared with ONTAK monotherapy.244 The synergistic interac.tion of intracellular signaling events by ONTAK with activation of endonucleases and apoptosis-associated caspases by steroids enhances sensitivity to apoptosis in cells unable to internalize the IL-2 fusion toxin.244 A potential limitation of IL-2 fusion toxins is that some neoplastic cells do not express the high-affinity IL-2 receptor. Pretreatment with IL-1. before DAB389IL-2 may overcome this resistance, as IL-1. induces IL-2 receptor expression.245 Concomitant steroid administration, as previously discussed, may also overcome a lack of IL-2 receptor expression. In addition, IL-1. pretreatment in SŽzary syndrome demonstrates increased cytotoxicity versus fusion pro.tein treatment alone, whereas normal cells were not sensitized to DAB389IL-2 with IL-1. pretreatment.245 IL-12. IL-12 is a cytokine that acts as a potent inducer of IFN-. production and a promoter of TH1 differenti.ation of T lymphocytes.246-248 IL-12 also enhances NK cell cytotoxicity249 and cytotoxic T-cell proliferation and action.246 A deficiency of IL-12 production has been demonstrated in advanced CTCL.37 Culture of CTCL cells with recombinant IL-12 restores IFN-. production and enhances cell-mediated cytotoxicity.37 Thus administration of exogenous IL-12 may be ther.apeutic in patients with CTCL. A phase I dose-escalation trial of recombinant human IL-12 in 10 patients with CTCL involving twice-weekly subcutaneous injections reported CR in 40% stage II, PR in 40% stage II, and PR in 33% patients with SŽzary syndrome.250 No response was noted in patients with large cell transformation. Minimal side effects included low-grade fever and headache.250 Vaccine Therapy. Anti-idiotype (Ab2) vaccine is a murine monoclonal IgG antibody, 4DC6, which mim.ics gp37, a unique tumor-associated cell-surface gly.coprotein.251 It has been shown to be successful in ani.mal models and promising in subsequent trials with human colorectal cancer and melanoma.251 A phase I trial evaluating the efficacy of Ab2 involved 4 patients with CTCL. Two patients showed significant clinical responses, with steady declines in serum LDH in one and improved immune response as measured by rising antibody titers in the other.251 The third patient showed no clinical improvement; it was too early to assess the fourth patient at the studyÕs conclusion. Toxicity was negligible, but delayed-type hypersensitivity was noted in 2 patients. Further studies evaluating the util.ity of vaccine therapy are pending. Berger et al252 evaluated the clonotypic T-cell recep.tor for potential sources of unique immunogenic pep.tides for CTCL. Peptide components from the T-cell receptor . variable chain that are selectively recog.nized by autologous CD8 T cells were identified. Curr Probl Dermatol, November/December 2001 FIG 8. Treatment algorithm. (Reprinted with permission from Kim YH, Hoppe RT. Mycosis fungoides and the SŽzary syn.drome. Semin Oncol 1999;26:276-89.) These tumor-specific peptide antigens may provide a basis for the development of an anti-tumor vaccine for CTCL immunotherapy. Additional peptide pools are being sequenced, and murine studies are in progress to determine optimal vaccination strategies.252 Bone Marrow Transplantation. Autologous bone marrow transplantation was performed in 6 patients who had stage IIB-IVB CTCL, with CR achieved in 5 of 6 patients.253 Although 3 had responses that lasted less than 100 days, the remaining 2 maintained re.sponse for over 1 year.253 Significant concern for increased risk of development of life-threatening infections from skin flora was alleviated, as septicemia developed in only 1 of 6 patients treated.253 In addition, Sterling et al254 treated a patient who had erythroder.mic mycosis fungoides with TBI and autologous bone marrow transplantation with successful improvement for 5 months. PUVA, TSEBT, and systemic retinoid therapy had failed in the patient.254 Furthermore, allo.geneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a patient with stage IIB mycosis fungoides was success.fully performed with current remission lasting for more than 8 months.255 Combination Therapy Combination therapy uses 2 or more treatment mo.dalities to maximize host response and disease regres.sion. Popular combinations join radiation therapy or phototherapy with oral systemic agents. The decision is based primarily on stage of disease and intention to treat or to provide palliation. Adverse effects must be taken into account, because re-administration of toxic regimens will not likely be tolerated. The treatment algorithm proposed in Fig 8 directs treatment accord.ing to stage of disease. Overall responses are encouraging, but the duration of response continues to be short. The number of reg.imens in practice highlights the need for more effec.tive therapeutic options. The Future There will continue to be a push to develop treat.ments with improved efficacy and decreased side effects. Therapies that are immunomodulatory without being immunosuppressing will become even more popular. Controlled, multicenter, head-to-head treatment tri.als will be necessary to determine which treatments have true efficacy, tolerable side effects, and survival benefit. REFERENCES 1.

Diagnosis is often delayed due to its variable and often benign clinical appearance. Case presentation: This case presents a 64-year-old man with a six-month-history of a recurrent diffuse and erythematous painless swelling below the left eye. Several resections with intraoperatively negative resection margins followed, but positive margins were repeatedly detected later on permanent sections. Histopathologic examination of the specimen diagnosed a cutaneous angiosarcoma. Neither, finally achieved negative margins on permanent sections, nor a following chemotherapy could prevent the recurrence of the disease after five months and the patient's dead 21 months after the first diagnosis. Conclusion: The case elucidates the current diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma of this entity, which shows an unfavourable clinical course in spite of multimodal therapy. Background A cutaneous angiosarcoma (synonyms: lymphangiosar.coma and haemangiosarcoma) is a rare malignant tumour of vascular endothelial cells. It occurs predominantly in the elderly and is confined to the face and the scalp region in more than 50% of cases [1]. Despite the aggressive behaviour and poor prognosis, the diagnosis is often delayed due to its variable and often benign clinical appearance. This case documents a facial cutaneous angi.osarcoma in an elderly male patient, revealing the diag.nostic and therapeutic dilemma of this entity, which shows an unfavourable clinical course in spite of multi-modal therapy. Case report A 64-year-old man presented with a six month history of a recurrent diffuse and erythematous painless swelling (3 . 2 cm2) below the left eye to the Department of Derma.tology, Regensburg University, Germany. Cervical lym.phadenopathy was clinically not detectable. Routine laboratory results showed no abnormality. Presuming an allergic dermatitis, topical treatment with steroids was ini-Page 1 of 5 (page number not for citation purposes) Head & Face Medicine 2008, 4:18 http://www.head-face-med.com/content/4/1/18 tiated. Because of the persistence of the lesion, an inci.sional biopsy was performed three weeks later (Figure 1). Histopathology of the specimen showed an invasively growing tumour of the dermis, composed of atypical vas.cular endothelia in a disordered manner, forming bizarre vascular lumina. The tumor cells were characterized by an elevated proliferated activity with a proliferation fraction (MIB-1) of 5%Ð10%. The vascular endothelial prolifera.tion showed a papillary architecture accompanied by small lymphocytes. The majority of endothelial cells pre.sented a hyperchromatic nucleus and a swollen cyto.plasm. (Figure 2a, 2b, 2c). Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated positivity for CD 31 (Figure 2d) and factor VIII-related antigen. Based on these findings the diagnosis of a cutaneous angiosarcoma was made. After referral of the patient to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Regensburg University, Germany, the tumour was removed by wide local surgical excision (Figure 3) and the defect was temporarily covered by Epi.gard. Despite negative intraoperative frozen section mar.gins, positive margins were repeatedly detected later on permanent sections. Negative margins on permanent sec.tion were finally reached after three resections and infraorbital soft tissue was plastically reconstructed with a buccal rotation flap. After surgery, chemotherapy fol.lowed with six cycles of alpha-interferon. Five months later a periorbital redness and swelling on both sides (Figure 4) required another incisional biopsy, which was confirmed as recurrent angiosarcoma on his.topathological examination. Imaging staging procedures (MRI and CT head-neck, CT chest, CT abdomen, PET and bone scan) found bone invasion to the nasal root (Figure 5). Metastases to the neck lymph nodes as well as distant metastases were clinically and radiologically excluded. Neither radiochemotherapy with a cumulative radiation dose of 64.8 Gy and seven cycles Doxorubicin nor an additional antiangiogenetic therapy with Trofosfamide, Pioglitazone, Rofecoxibe and steroids could prevent the rapid tumour progression. The patient died 21 months after the first diagnosis. Discussion There are three main types of cutaneous angiosarcoma: Idiopathic angiosarcoma of the head and neck in elderly patients, lymphoedema-associated angiosarcoma (Stew.art-Treves-Syndrome) and postirradiation angiosarcoma [2]. Besides an association with persistent chronic lym.phoedema, previous irradiation and pre-existing vascular malformation, little is known regarding the causative fac.tors of that disease [3]. With respect to pathogenesis, among others, upregulation of the glykopeptide VEGF-D, a vascular endothelial growth factor, seems to be respon.sible for the endothelial cell proliferation [4]. Clinically the appearance of a cutaneous angiosarcoma of the skin and scalp can be variable. Early lesions most com.monly present as single or multifocal ill-defined, bruise-like erythematous-purplish areas with indurated borders [5]. In the present case, akin to those previously described by others [6,7], these haematoma-like lesions can be mis.interpreted as benign inflammatory or allergic hypere.mias. More advanced lesions can present as dark bluish, sometimes keratotic papules or nodules with ulceration and bleeding, mimicking other malignancies like squa.mous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, lymphoma as well as metastases [3,5,8]. Microscopically a cutaneous angiosarcoma is typically characterized by numerous, irregular and anastomosing vascular channels. These are lined by pleomorphic, hyper-Page 2 of 5 (page number not for citation purposes) Head & Face Medicine 2008, 4:18 http://www.head-face-med.com/content/4/1/18 Figure 2 Histopathology. a: Overview image: Epidermis, followed by dermis with hair follicles and sebaceous glands.

Immunhistochemical positivity for the endothelial markers CD 31 and factor VIII-related antigen as well as for the transcription factor Fli-1 may help to establish diagnosis [10,11]. The differential diagnosis includes hemangioma, especially tufted, cavernous and epithelioid hemangioma on the one hand and acantholytic carci.noma on the other hand. Especially in immunocompro.mised patients Kaposi-sarcoma might be a further differential diagnosis. In the current case the presence of many lymphocytes might be a hint to regard the lesion as of lymphatic vessel origin, i.e. as a lymphangiosarcoma. Treatment of the cutaneous angiosarcoma is generally based on radical surgery and postoperative radiation ther.apy. Surgery is postulated to attain a wide excision of the tumour with histologically negative margins [1,4]. Unfor.tunately achieving negative margins is difficult, as multi-focal and extensive microscopic spread is common in this disease. Intraoperative frozen sections are often per.formed to assist in determining section margins. Pawlik et al. [5] demonstrated, however, an overall negative predic.tive value of only 33.3% for that procedure, which explains the repeating surgical resections in the case report. For this reason, temporary reconstruction with homografts or skin substitutes is recommended until the definite histological confirmation of margin status. Since up to 78% of the patients still have residual tumour after wide and multiple surgical resections [5,12], this goal of achieving histologically negative section margins remains Page 3 of 5 (page number not for citation purposes) Head & Face Medicine 2008, 4:18 http://www.head-face-med.com/content/4/1/18 debatable. In many cases the resulting extensive resection defects require large secondary plastic reconstruction. More recently, chemotherapy and gene therapy are increasingly available. Doxorubicin is reported to be active in angiosarcoma [13], but did not show response in the present patient. Paclitaxel is another agent, that seems to have substantial effects, even in patients, who were treated previously with chemotherapy or radiation ther.apy [2,14]. In more palliative situations, antiangiogentic therapy with pioglitazone, rofecoxib and metronomic tro.fosfamide has been recommended [15]. Conclusion Despite multimodal therapy options, prognosis of the cutaneous angiosarcoma is still poor, with a 5-year-sur.vival rate between 12% and 33%. About half of the patients are dying within 15 to 18 months of presentation [1,5,16]. The most important positive prognostic factors seem to be young age, small tumour size, negative resec.tion margins and radiation therapy [3,5,8]. In summary, the present case of a cutaneous angiosar.coma of the face elucidates the current diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma of this lesion. Diagnosis is often delayed, due to its putatively innocous clinical appear.ance. Negative microscopic section margins are hardly achieved during surgery, resulting in multiple operations with large postoperative defects. Despite multimodal ther.apy concepts, the prognosis remains poor. Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests. Authors' contributions TE drafted the manuscript.

Given the vascular endothelial cell origin of angiosarcoma, tumours may develop in essentially any organ; however, there is a predilection for the skin where half of all tumours arise, increasing in prevalence with age. The most common risk factors are chronic lymphoedema and history of radiation. We review the most important radiological findings along the spectrum of angiosarcoma from head to toe throughout the body, including uncommon and rare locations. Key imaging features of angiosarcoma across multiple organ systems will be described, as well as the impact on management and prognosis. INTRODUCTION Angiosarcoma is an aggressive, malignant endothelial-cell tu.mour of lymphatic or vascular origin.1Ð3 It has a high rate of local recurrence and metastasis.4 Angiosarcoma represents ,1% of all soft-tissue sarcomas, with a generally poor prog.nosisand overallsurvivalranging anywhere from 6to 16 months.3,5Ð7 Angiosarcoma arises from vascular endothelial cells which show atypia and can grow along pre-existing vascular chan.nels, sinusoidal or cavernous spaces. They can also form poorly organized vessels, solid masses or nodules.8 The pathological appearance of angiosarcoma varies according to the tumour grade. Low-grade angiosarcoma displays a small solid component with low-grade cytology and abundant open vascular lumina. High-grade lesions are densely cellular and inÞltrative with a high mitotic rate and atypical cells. High-grade tumours have a variable amount of vascular lumen formation that can be focal in appearance. 8,9 Histopathological identiÞcation of angiosarcoma is some.times challenging because it can be mistaken for other vascular tumours. In the low-grade form, angiosarcoma may resemble a haemangioma, whereas the aggressive form may have overlapping features with anaplastic melanoma and epithelial carcinomas.4,9 Because angiosarcoma is such a rare entity, most knowl.edge is derived from case reports or small cohort studies that are limited by small sample sizes, incomplete data and diverse treatment approaches.3 In fact, only a few pub.lished reports include .100 patients. Nonetheless, useful cumulative information regarding this endothelial cell tu.mour has been observed.6 Owing to its origin from endothelial cells, angiosarcoma can develop throughout the body and can occur at any age.10 However, they are more common in older individ.uals, with a reported median age between 60 and 71 years;6 there is generally no gender predilection except for cuta.neous lesions, which have been shown to be more preva.lent among males.8 The cutaneous form is the most common, accounting for about half of all tumours, with the head and neck as the most frequently involved region.11 SpeciÞcally, the scalp accounts for approximately 50% of all angiosarcoma cases, yet this still only comprises ,0.1% of all head and neck malignancies. Only 10% of all angio.sarcomas occur in deep soft tissues, and the rest are found in parenchymal organs such as the breast, bone, spleen and liver.5,12 Angiosarcoma primarily spreads haematoge.nously, with the lungs as the most common site for me.tastases. Metastases also frequently affect the liver (Figure 8), bones (Figure 2), soft tissues and lymph nodes.3 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjr/article/90/1075/20170039/7446109 by Arizona State University Ross-Blakley Law Library user on 11 April 2024 There is usually multiorgan involvement at the time of di.agnosis, often rendering it difÞcult to ascertain the site of origin and approach to therapy.10 The classiÞcation of angiosarcoma is based on both the site of origin as well as the underlying risk factors involved. Angio.sarcoma can be divided into primary cutaneous (in the absence of lymphoedema or radiation), parenchymal tissue/visceral (which includes primary breast lesions), deep soft tissue, and lymphoedema-associated and post-radiation angiosarcomas.3,5 Furthermore, as scientiÞc advances are made in molecular and genetic biology, angiosarcoma can be genetically discriminated from other sarcomas with greater potential for improved ther.apeutic outcomes.5 Herein, this article provides a clinical and imaging review of angiosarcoma by anatomical site, summarizing the key clinical and imaging characteristics of this rare cancer. AETIOLOGY There are well-established risk factors linked to the development of angiosarcoma; the two most common are chronic lymphoe.dema and radiation therapy. Other factors include familial syndromes, exposure to environmental chemical toxins and foreign bodies.3,13,14 Chronic lymphoedema, irrespective of its cause (e.g. following breast cancer treatment, parasitic infections such as Þlariasis or MilroyÕs disease) is a deÞnite risk factor for angiosarcoma, a phenomenon given the name StewartÐTreves syndrome.13 Some reports attribute radiation-induced angiosarcoma arising after the treatment of breast cancer as more likely related to radiation and/or lymphoedema.3,8 Radiation therapy is another independent risk factor for subsequent angiosarcoma development, contributing to about one-fourth of all cases.3,15 This applies to a variety of cancers that may be treated with radiation (e.g. cervical cancer, endometrial cancer and lym.phoma) in addition to breast cancer. Large epidemiological studies have conÞrmed the increased risk of angiosarcoma following ad.juvant radiotherapy for breast cancer. 3,8 To differentiate it from lymphoedema-associated angiosarcoma, radiation-induced angio.sarcoma must fulÞl certain criteria including pathological conÞr.mation, location within the radiation Þeld and occurrence several years after treatment with no evidence of chronic lymphoedema. Post-radiation angiosarcoma arising in sites other than the breast tends to occur at least 10 years after the diagnosis of the primary cancer. Conversely, most post-radiation angiosarcoma has been reported to develop within 5 years after radiation treatment for 8,16breast cancer. Familial syndromes associated with angiosarcoma include neu.roÞbromatosis type-1, Maffucci syndrome, bilateral retinoblas.toma, von Recklinghausen syndrome, haemochromatosis and KlippelÐTrenaunay syndrome. Studies have also documented the ability of angiosarcomas to originate within other lesions such as port wine stains, haemangiomas and lymphangiomas, albeit 3,5,9,16 a rare occurrence. There is also a link between chemical exposure and angio.sarcoma which is most evident with hepatic lesions. Some of the known chemical toxins include the occupational use of vinyl chloride, iatrogenic exposure to thorium dioxide (Thorotrast¨) for radiological examinations in the past, arsenic containing insecticides used in agriculture and long-term use of anabolic steroids.5,17 Additionally, foreign body-associated angiosarcoma may in part be due to synthetic materials used in grafts or prostheses (e.g. Dacron¨) vs chronic sequelae of an otherwise-normal foreign body reaction to items such as shrapnel, steel, surgical sponges and bone wax.5,18 The observation of angiosarcoma in patients with renal trans.plantation has raised suspicion that immunosuppression may be a risk factor involved in the development of this tumour. The exact pathogenesis, however, is unclear, including their pre.dilection to occur at or near the site of arteriovenous Þstulae.3,5,16,19,20 Despite the suggestion by some epidemiologi.cal studies that angiosarcoma occurs with increased frequency in Figure 1.

In each category, there is a concise review of the clinical presentation and prognosis, with a special emphasis on the imaging features and utility of various imaging modalities. Angiosarcoma of the head and neck Approximately 60% of angiosarcoma occurs in the head and neck, making this the most common site. The locations most often encountered in the head and neck are the scalp (Figure 3), fol.lowed by the face and then the neck, often with a multifocal presentation (Figure 3). These tumoursÑalso known as WilsonÐ Jones angiosarcoma, senile angiosarcoma or malignant angioen.dotheliomaÑare primarily found in elderly persons.22 Patients often present with skin lesions such as an enlarging bruise, a dis.coloured nodule or persistent ulceration. In the early stages, these lesions can be misdiagnosed for benign entities caused by cellulitis, infection or skin injuries. The differential diagnosis includes haemangioblastoma, Kaposi sarcoma, metastatic cancer from an unknown primary site, sinonasal squamous-cell cancer and Merkel cell carcinoma.23 MRI features include intermediate T1 signal intensity with pos.sible areas of hyperintensity indicating the presence of haemor.rhage and high T2 signal intensity (Figure 3). The most diagnostic Þnding is the presence of high-ßow serpentine vessels (low signal intensity on both T1 and T2 weighted images) in an otherwise solid non-speciÞc soft-tissue mass. Low ßow vessels, however, may show hyperintensity on T2 weighted images. Angiosarcoma demonstrates enhancement after intravenous contrast adminis.tration and may show non-enhancing areas reßecting tumour necrosis.4 Although these imaging features are relatively non.speciÞc, they often indicate malignancy and should prompt bi.opsy for further characterization. Primary brain angiosarcoma is exceptionally rare, with only isolated cases reported in the literature. The imaging appearance is non-speciÞc and differential diagnosis includes glioma, cav.ernoma and haemorrhagic metastasis.24 Similar to previously reported cases,25 we present one case of a primary brain Figure 3.

(a) Ultrasound image with Doppler of the right forearm shows diffuse soft-tissue mass with heterogeneous echotexture and increased vascularity (white arrows). Axial T1 weighted MR images (b) without and (c) with intravenous contrast demonstrate diffuse soft-tissue oedema with diffuse, extensive, infiltrative cutaneous and subcutaneous multinodular soft-tissue tumour along the volar tissues of the right forearm with involvement of underlying fascia and musculature (black arrows). On MR, the signal characteristics include bright signal intensity on T2 weighted and intermediate signal intensity on T1 weighted images, with invasion of the surrounding tissues (Figure 5). Foci of high signal intensity indicating adjacent haemorrhage can also be seen on T1 weighted images.23 Vessels within the tumour may demonstrate high ßow (low signal intensity on all pulse sequen.ces) or low ßow (increased signal intensity on T2 weighted images). There is tumour enhancement after administration of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast, potentially with central areas of necrosis (Figures 2 and 6).2 High soft-tissue vascularity and perfusion result in an increased rate of enhancement.4 On diffusion weighted imaging, there is a very low apparent diffusion coefÞcient, which is characteristic of soft-tissue malignancies.23 Angiosarcoma may appear as a plaque-like subcutaneous mass in the background of an enlarged extremity with oedema which represents underlying lymphoedema (Figure 6).4 On positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, avid ßuorine-18 ßudeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake is usually seen.27 Angiosarcoma of the breast Primary angiosarcoma of the breast is not common and is of un.known aetiology. It refers to those tumours that arise within the breast parenchyma as opposed to lesions from the overlying skin. It represents only 0.04% of all breast tumours and about 8% of breast sarcomas. 18 Primary breast angiosarcoma is highly aggressive and tends to affect younger females, usually presenting as a palpable mass. 28 Secondary breast angiosarcoma most often occurs follow.ing local radiation therapy with a latent period between 5 and 6years.29,30 In addition, chronic lymphoedema of the breast is a risk factor for secondary breast angiosarcoma.14 Primary breast angiosarcoma has an unfavourable prognosis with a 5-year survival between 8% and 50%.18 Secondary angiosarcoma tend to have a poor prognosis. Five-year overall survival rate for radiation-associated angiosarcoma (RAS) ranges from 10Ð54% where local recurrence is seen in 45Ð64%ofpatientsand resultsina25Ð30% mortality rate. Distant metastases are diagnosed in 27Ð42% of patients and are associated with a 75Ð89% mortality rate. Some of the prognostic factors affecting the outcome include completeness of surgical resection, patientÕsage,and tumour size.Local re.currence is an adverse prognostic indicator and is often associated 29,30,31with distant metastases. Surgical resection (mastectomy or lumpectomy), chemotherapy and irradiation are among treatment options for breast angiosarcoma.18 The imaging Þndings for breast angiosarcoma are varied and sometimes absent altogether, making diagnosis challenging. Mammography may show a solitary ill-deÞned uncalciÞed mass ranging in size from 3 to 6 cm in primary angiosarcoma while ultrasound shows predominantly hypoechoic solitary or multiple masses. 32 However, hyperechoic masses have also been associated with angiosarcoma.33 In secondary angiosarcoma, mammographic Þndings are often non-speciÞc, with skin thickening sometimes as the only relevant Þnding. It may be difÞcult to differentiate dermal lesions from skin thickening secondary to radiation.29,32 Since mammographic and sonographic Þndings can be non-speciÞc, MR may be more helpful in characterizing these lesions.28 In pri.mary angiosarcoma, MRI features include a heterogeneous mass of low signal intensity on T1 weighted and high signal on T2 weighted images. On dynamic post-contrast imaging, the tumours show rapid enhancement (Figure 1) with varying washout kinetics according to the tumour grade. High-grade tumours commonly show rapid washout, whereas lower grade tumours usually exhibit persistent or plateau enhancement curves. 32,34 High signal haemorrhagic foci on T1 weighted images can be seen with high-grade tumours.29 Chikarmane et al35 studied MRI characteristics of radiation-induced breast angiosarcoma. Diffuse T2 high-signal skin thickening was noted in all of the 16 patients studied. Low T2 signal intensity lesions were seen in six patients. All lesions showed rapid en.hancement on contrast-enhanced T1 weighted images. Four patients showed breast parenchymal masses on mammography and MRI. 18F-FDG PET/CT shows intense metabolic activity in primary and secondary breast angiosarcoma, valuable both for initial evaluation and restaging.36 Cardiac and pulmonary artery angiosarcoma Angiosarcoma is the most-common differentiated malignant neo.plasm of the heart and accounts for 10Ð15% of primary cardiac malignancies.37 Approximately 80% of cardiac angiosarcoma cases Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjr/article/90/1075/20170039/7446109 by Arizona State University Ross-Blakley Law Library user on 11 April 2024 5of 15 birpublications.org/bjr Br J Radiol;90:20170039 Figure 7.

Patients often present with dyspnoea and chest pain as well as hypotension, tachycardia and syncope. 37 because there is asymmetric involvement of the right heart, symptoms can be sec.ondary to right-sided diastolic dysfunction and cardiac tamponade.38 Superior vena cava syndrome is a reported complication of cardiac angiosarcoma, and when recalcitrant to treatment approaches, pal.liative superior vena cava stenting may be considered.39 The differential diagnosis is broad and includes metastases, myxoma, thrombus, lymphoma, myxosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.40,41 The prognosis is very poor with a mean survival of 3 months to 4 years. Because cardiac angiosarcoma is refractory to treatment, local recurrence and metastases (Figure 8) are seen usually within 1 year of attempted treatment. Treatment options include chemotherapy and palliative radiation. Palliative surgery may also prolong survival.5 Macroscopically, cardiac angiosarcoma has irregular borders and often invades the adjacent pericardium.42 There are two patterns of growth of cardiac angiosarcoma: (1) a well-deÞned mass with haemorrhagic and necrotic components that extend from the Figure 8.

Other potential abnormalities include widened me.diastinum, right-sided heart enlargement and hilar adenopathy.44 CT demonstrates a predominantly, highly vascu.lar right atrial mass (Figure 8) that involves the cardiac cham.bers and may be nodular or irregular.44,45 Cardiac angiosarcomas are usually isointense on T1 weighted and hyperintense on T2 weighted MR images (Figure 8) and may demonstrate an irregular pattern of enhancement.46 Typically, they exhibit a tubular morphology and have internal ßow voids, and they may have a characteristic lobulated ÒcaulißowerÓ conÞguration (Figure 8).43 On gradient echo T1 weighted sequences, the hypointense layer with phase shift is thought to represent susceptibility effect secondary to haemorrhage within 40,46the tumour due to its highly vascular nature. In addition, a characteristic ÒsunrayÓ appearance of pericardial involvement on contrast-enhanced MRI has been described.47 On steady-state free precession images, angiosarcomas appear hyperintense relative to the myocardium. Haemorrhage and necrosis are seen as foci of high and low signal intensities within the tumour on steady-state free precession images, respectively.38 Pulmonary artery angiosarcoma (Figure 9) is rare, and its identiÞcation is often delayed due to misdiagnosis as bland pulmonary embolism with subsequent anticoagulation.8,48 Pul.monary artery sarcomas have a poor prognosis, with more than half of the patients surviving less than 1 year. 49 Pulmonary artery angiosarcoma is typically detected during contrast-enhanced CT chest imaging. CT imaging demonstrates a Þll.ing defect within the main pulmonary arteries that appears similar to pulmonary thromboembolism (Figure 9). Both enti.ties have similar clinical and diagnostic features. However, CT features that are diagnostic of sarcoma over pulmonary embo.lism include an irregular low-attenuation Þlling defect with enhancement and extravascular extension (Figure 9).48,50 Hepatic angiosarcoma Hepatic angiosarcoma is uncommon and accounts for only 2% of all primary hepatic malignancies, but it is the most common malignant mesenchymal tumour of the liver.8,51 It pre.dominantly affects patients aged 50Ð70 years, with a slight male predilection.52 In the majority of cases of primary hepatic angiosarcoma, no obvious risk factor can be identiÞed. However, it is reported that the tumour has an association with environmental, iatrogenic and occupational exposure to certain carcinogens. These include thorium dioxide, vinyl chloride, arsenic and radiation. Haemochromatosis and von Recklinghausen disease are also known to be linked to angiosarcoma.3 As with other aggressive hepatic tumours, the most common presentation is abdominal pain, weakness, fatigue and weight loss with jaundice, hepatomegaly and ascites.19 These tumours have a very poor prognosis, with a median survival reported to be just 6 months.53 Metastases are commonly observed at the time of presentation, with the lungs and spleen being the most frequent sites.54 Portal vein thrombosis, BuddÐChiari syndrome and arteriovenous shunting-related high-output heart failure are some of the complications of hepatic angiosarcoma.55 Moreover, spontaneous rupture of tumours with massive intra-abdominal bleeding has been seen in multiple cases.56 Hepatic angio.sarcomas are known to increase risk for haemorrhage after percutaneous liver biopsy. The gross pathology and imaging Þndings of hepatic angio.sarcoma can show four different patterns: multiple nodules (Figure 8), a large dominant mass (Figure 10), a combination of dominant mass and smaller nodules (Figure 11), and rarely, a diffusely inÞltrating micronodular tumour.57Ð61 The two pre.dominant patterns are large solitary mass and multifocal lesions.62 The CT appearance of angiosarcoma of the liver is consistent with that of an aggressive vascular tumour (Figures 10 and 11).54 Unenhanced CT demonstrates a predominantly hypoattenuating mass when compared with the surrounding liver parenchyma, with or without hyperattenuating foci, known to reßect haemorrhage.1,52,63 Hepatic angiosarcoma resulting from tho.rium dioxide exposure produces distinct imaging Þndings of a hypoattenuating mass on unenhanced CT with hyper-attenuating linear meshwork appearance characteristic of re.sidual Thorotrast, as well as a dense spleen and lymph nodes resulting from the agent (Figure 11).52,62 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjr/article/90/1075/20170039/7446109 by Arizona State University Ross-Blakley Law Library user on 11 April 2024 7of 15 birpublications.org/bjr Br J Radiol;90:20170039 Figure 10. A 54-year-old female with primary hepatic angiosarcoma. T1 weighted post-contrast MR images during arterial (a), portal venous (b) and delayed (c) phases show a dominant mass at the medial liver dome demonstrating progressive nodular enhancement that is similar to blood pool and resembles a cavernous haemangioma. However, multiple additional lesions are present, with a somewhat more irregular pattern of progressive enhancement. Similar to other vascular tumours, the masses are predominately hyperechoic at ultrasound (d). Contrast-enhanced CT images several months later in portal venous (e) and delayed (f) phases show marked interval tumour growth but with haemangioma-like enhancement pattern retained. On contrast-enhanced CT, large dominant masses exhibit het.erogeneous enhancement, which indicates central necrosis and Þbrotic change (Figure 10). Small nodular lesions usually appear as hypoattenuating areas with some enhancing foci (Figure 10). Irregular or ring enhancement can also be seen (Figure 11). The enhancement is usually less than that of the aorta in the early phases with delayed progressive enhancement.64,65 On MRI, angiosarcoma has a heterogeneous appearance that reßects areas of haemorrhage, Þbrosis and necrosis (Figure 10).64 If a dominant mass is present, the internal architecture is hyperintense on T2 with internal septae that are hypointense. T1 weighted images show low-intensity lesions with focal areas of increased signal due to haemorrhage. Angiosarcoma demonstrates a wide range of appar.ent diffusion coefÞcient (ADC) values, which is due to their het.erogeneous composition. Lower ADC values may be attributed to haematoma, intermediate to progressively enhancing foci that may represent vascular channels and high values secondary to diffusion within cystic necrosis. There can be signiÞcant variability in the ADC map of different lesions, including those of the same patient.64 Figure 11.

Abdominal radiograph (a) shows dense, shrunken spleen and dense abdominal lymph nodes compatible with prior Thorotrast exposure.

The Þndings of this study described the tumour en.hancement in different phases of the dynamic post-contrast study. The lesions showed small foci of heterogeneous hyperenhacement on the Þrst post-contrast phase that progressively expand on the subsequent phases, and typically follow blood pool with regard to CT attenuation and MR signal intensity (Figure 10). Other com.mon Þndings were large hypovascular regions within the domi.nant lesions in addition to smaller hypovascular nodules (Figures 10 and 11). Smaller studies by Bruegel et al66 and Koyama et al52 showed progressive heterogeneous enhancement in most instances with multiphasic CT and/or MR. The characteristic tumour progressive enhancement that follows the blood pool can sometimes resemble cavernous haemangio.mas (Figure 10).1,67Ð69 However, the typical enhancement of hepatic angiosarcoma is of less attenuation than the aorta and hepatic artery; this is in contrast to haemangiomas that have regions of enhancement similar to the aorta during all phases of imaging.68,69 Additionally, enhancement of angiosarcoma is more irregular and disordered, even when there is progressive Þll in from the periphery of the tumour (Figure 10). In their study, Pickhardt et al64 described centrifugal enhancement or a Òre.verse haemangiomaÓ pattern and a complex mixture of pro.gressive centripetal and centrifugal enhancement in cases of hepatic angiosarcoma. With precise review of the enhancement pattern, distinction from benign haemangiomas is typically possible. On 18F-FDG PET CT, angiosarcoma is 18F-FDG avid and PET is generally used for detection of distant metastases, which are usually present at the time of presentation.11,70 In summary, cross-sectional imaging Þndings of hepatic angio.sarcoma reßect the highly variable histopathological composition of angiosarcomas. Typical imaging features include multifocal, heterogeneous internal architecture often containing haemorrhage within large lesions; disordered, patchy arterial phase enhancement pattern is progressive during the later phases.64 Splenic angiosarcoma Primary angiosarcoma of the spleen is very rare and is slightly more common in males (Figure 12). Patients may present with constitutional symptoms, abdominal pain from splenomegaly, anaemia and thrombocytopaenia.71,72 Splenic angiosarcoma has a 6-month survival rate of 20%.73 In cases of splenic rupture, the mean survival is only 4Ð5 months.74,75 Splenic angiosarcoma is usually treated with splenectomy because of the high risk of splenic rupture. However, treatment for splenic angiosarcoma is rarely curative due to the aggressive nature of the tumour.71 Splenectomy may expand the mean survival time to 14 months, emphasizing the value of prompt diagnosis.76 Many imaging modalities can be used for evaluating splenic angiosarcoma. Ultrasonography is often the initial imaging modality.71,77 The reported ultrasonography features include variable presence of splenomegaly with splenic masses of mixed 71,78,79echogenicity and increased internal Doppler ßow. On CT, splenic angiosarcoma masses enhance heterogeneously with areas of necrosis (Figure 12); hyperdense haemorrhage may be seen within the tumour on non-contrast images or as extrasplenic in the event of rupture. On MR, areas of in.terspersed increased and decreased signal intensity reßect foci of solid tumour with areas of necrosis.71 Early spread to the liver may make determination of primary site difÞcult (Figure 12). Osseous angiosarcoma Angiosarcoma of the bone is rare and accounts for ,1% of primary bone tumours.80 Approximately 6% of angiosarcomas originate in the bones.81 The peak incidence is in the third to Þfth decades of life, and two-thirds of affected patients are males.58 The most common presenting symptom is swelling at the affected site with associated pain. Pathological fractures are common. 59 Osseous angiosarcoma can occur in any bone type but the majority (60%) occurs in long bones, with the tibia being the most common site, followed by the femur, humerus and pelvis.82 The majority present as solitary tumours, but ap.proximately one-third are multifocal.59 Osseous angiosarcoma is managed by surgical resection when possible, often combined with chemoradiation therapy.83 Risk Figure 12. A 62-year-old male with splenic angiosarcoma. (a) Unenhanced and (b) contrast-enhanced CT images show marked splenomegaly with irregular peripheral enhancement (b). Multiple liver lesions are also present, presumably from metastatic spread. Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjr/article/90/1075/20170039/7446109 by Arizona State University Ross-Blakley Law Library user on 11 April 2024 9of15 birpublications.org/bjr Br J Radiol;90:20170039 factors for osseous angiosarcoma include history of prior radiation and/or lymphoedema at the tumour site, surgical implants near the tumour site, a previous bone infarction and PagetÕs disease.59,84,85 The tumour has a poor prognosis with one study reporting 66% of cases having distant metastases at the time of diagnosis and 5-year survival rate of 60%.81 Factors that negatively impact survival include intermediate-or high-grade tumours and tumours arising in an irradiated Þeld.58 Typically, osseous angiosarcoma is initially detected on conven.tional radiography. The radiographic appearance is variable, but most exhibit a destructive, lytic pattern on radiographs without a sclerotic margin, which may be an indicator of aggressiveness (Figure 5).86 If thetumour islow grade, thebonemay be ex.panded. High-grade tumours typically exhibit extension through the cortex and involvement of the regional soft tissues (Figure 5).86 Multicentric lesions may show a soap-bubble appearance with involvement of multiple adjacent vertebrae in the spine and ex.tension up and down the cortex of a long bone.59 CT appearance is variable, demonstrating similar patterns overall to that seen on radiography.86 MRI appearance is compatible with an aggressive tumour associated with T1 hypointensity, heterogeneous T2 hyperintensity and irregular contrast en.hancement (Figure 2 and 5). The lesions may exhibit peripheral vascularity.82 In addition, ßuidÐßuid levels may be present due to necrosis and haemorrhage.87 Cross-sectional imaging features are not speciÞc enough to distinguish angiosarcoma from other similar primary osseous malignancies such as haemangioper.icytoma and haemangioendothelioma.82 Therefore, tissue sam.pling is crucial for accurate diagnosis. Skeletal scintigraphy (99mTc-methylene diphosphonate) and 18F-FDG PET can be used to assess for multifocality, where a high degree of uptake 86is seen. Rare locations Since angiosarcoma originates from vascular endothelium, it can arise anywhere in the body. Angiosarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract is very rare and can present as a primary lesion or metastatic disease.88 Case reports in the literature discuss the pathological characteristics of these tumours but not their radiological characteristics. Angiosarcoma of the urinary bladder is also an extremely rare and poorly characterized tumour. Patients usually present with pelvic pain and gross haematuria. CT and MRI demonstrate a large highly vascular mass with irregular margins. The tumour can protrude into the bladder lumen as well as extend into the extravesical region. Hydronephrosis, hydroureter and distant metastases are known associations.89 Angiosarcoma of thebaseofthe penisisarare entity that hasbeen mentioned in only a few isolated case reports (Figure 13).90Ð92 Total penile amputation may be needed due to high propensity for local recurrence, even for a superÞcial lesion.92 Primary testicular angiosarcomaisarare tumour in malesseen at all ages. It can be classiÞed into two subgroups: one group Figure 13. 59-and 63-year-old males with penile and spermatic cord angiosarcomas.

The latter may occur in association with chronic hydrocele.93 No im.aging features have been reported for these tumours. Angio.sarcoma arising in the spermatic cord can also be rarely seen (Figure 13). ANGIOSARCOMA METASTASES Regardless of its site of origin, angiosarcoma has a high tendency for metastatic multifocal disease.9,94 The dissemination of this tumour is predominantly haematogenous, early and aggressive. The lung is the most frequent site for metastatic angiosarcoma. Other frequent sites include the liver, bone and lymph nodes.9,95 As for the radiological appearance of metastatic angiosarcoma of the lungs, chest radiography shows bilateral peripheral solid nodules that are difÞcult to distinguish from those caused by other metastatic tumours. The most common CT manifestations are multiple solid nodular lesions, followed by multiple thin-walled cysts. Most of the solid lesions show inhomogeneous enhancement. In addition, mixed pattern tumours have been described, where both solid nodular and cystic lesions are seen concomitantly. Hilar adenopathy, punctate calciÞcation, pneu.mothorax and pleural effusions have also been described in 94,95 some patients with angiosarcoma lung metastases. Either of these presentations, solid or cystic, can often be observed with haemorrhagic change, which is considered Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjr/article/90/1075/20170039/7446109 by Arizona State University Ross-Blakley Law Library user on 11 April 2024 10 of 15 birpublications.org/bjr Br J Radiol;90:20170039 a characteristic Þnding in metastatic angiosarcoma. Haemor.rhagic changes may be due to the fragility of the neovascular tissue, which predisposes vessels to thrombosis and rupture. Radiologically, these haemorrhagic complications may present as airÐßuid levels in thin-walled cysts, diffuse pul.monary inÞltrates, haemothorax or areas of ground-glass attenuation.95 When discussing metastatic angiosarcoma of the liver, the common CT Þndings include multiple hypoattenuating lesions relative to the adjacent liver parenchyma. This is often associated with nodular enhancement and cystic attenuation with hae.morrhagic change (e.g. ßuid levels). On T1 weighted MR images, these tumours appeared heterogeneous and hypointense relative to adjacent liver parenchyma. Most show minimal peripheral enhancement after administration of intravenous gadolinium 96contrast. Few studies are available that have described the radiological presentation of metastatic angiosarcoma in the bone. Studies carried out on large cohorts or that have documented skeletal Þndings or metastatic pattern in the bone are not available.97 These reports are limited to case studies and several were sec.ondary to primary angiosarcoma of the spleen despite being an 97Ð99 uncommon site for primary tumours. In one study of a patient with primary splenic angiosarcoma, where pelvic MRI was followed by consecutive axial CT im.aging at corresponding sacral levels, the radiographical Þndings presented as well-circumscribed osteosclerosis and, to a much lesser extent, osteolytic lesions.97 Furthermore, cortical breaching was minimal. These authors conclude that MRI did not provide signiÞcant additional information in the discrim.ination of the disease and found MR T2 weighted images to be insensitive for many of the osteoblastic lesions, whereas T1 weighted images depicted most lesions but not all lesions already clearly visible by CT. Thus, they favour its application in follow-up imaging for the evaluation of treatment 97 response. Another study of a patient diagnosed with primary breast angiosarcoma revealed multiple well-deÞned bone lesions in the pelvis and lower spine, with high signal intensity on T2 weighted images and low signal intensity on T1 weighted images. These lesions showed persistentcontrastenhancement on more delayed phases, suggestive of metastases, and were conÞrmed by CT-guided biopsy.100 According to this study, MRI was a more useful tool in identifying osteoblastic bone metastases that were not detected on CT scan or PET/CT.100 ANGIOSARCOMA MANAGEMENT By and large, angiosarcomas have a poor prognosis with reported 5-year survival rates ranging from 12% to 35%.101 Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy and chemo.therapy, but outcomes vary widely and are impacted by site, size, resectability and tumour type (i.e. de novo vs radiation in.duced).101 Angiosarcomas of the scalp, compared with other sites, have a particularly poor prognosis with signiÞcant re.duction in overall survival. Although angiosarcomas secondary to prior radiation have improved outcomes in some studies, other research contradict this Þnding.101 The mainstay of treatment has traditionally been wide-margin surgical resection. However, this approach alone is problematic in cases that are non-resectable (as is often the case in lesions of the scalp).102 Furthermore, it has generally resulted in poor outcomes.101 Thus, some studies have advocated for a more aggressive local multimodality approach that entails both sur.gical resection and radiotherapy whenever possible, citing im.proved survival rates.101 In one series, the median overall survival is about 36 months after adjuvant radiotherapy com.pared with 9 months without adjuvant radiotherapy, whereas in another, the 5-year overall survival is about 45% with adjuvant radiotherapy and about 20% with surgical resection alone.103 It is important to note that angiosarcoma of certain sites require speciÞc considerations. For instance, lesions of the liver may beneÞt from embolization.102 As for adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of angio.sarcoma, there remains some controversy with respect to its therapeutic role, as well as little agreement on the choice of 104,105 agents. The most common chemotherapeutic drugs (targeting cytokines and their receptors) are Adriamycin¨, ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine, and paclitaxel is also typically administered weekly.105 Radiation-induced angiosarcomas seemed to fare as well to therapy as those that arose spontaneously.102 For recurrent cases of angiosarcoma, taxanes and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin have shown signiÞcant response rates. New and emerging therapeutic options are still under study, the most notable of which are the role of angiogenetic agents. Out of these numerous pro-angiogenetic factors, vascular permeabil.ity factor could be of major importance in the future of 102,103 angiosarcoma management. CONCLUSIONS Angiosarcoma is a rare, highly aggressive tumour that can affect any organ in the body but appears most commonly in its cu.taneous form, which accounts for nearly 50% of all tumours reported. It has a rather poor prognosis, particularly when the patient is diagnosed with metastases at initial presentation, as is often the case. The aetiology is typically unknown but there are deÞnite risk factors that have been identiÞed for angiosarcoma; the two most important are the presence of chronic lymphoe.dema and prior radiation therapy. Other risk factors include environmental carcinogens (vinyl chloride, thorium dioxide and arsenic), foreign bodies such as synthetic grafts and certain fa.milial syndromes. Multimodality imaging is necessary for proper staging and management. However, accurate radiological di.agnosis of angiosarcoma is as much of a challenge as its treat.ment. What is certain, however, is that the radiological presentation is quite variable. Early diagnosis can be improved by correlation for risk factors, particularly in cases where the radiological Þndings suggest the presence of a vascular tumour with aggressive features. Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bjr/article/90/1075/20170039/7446109 by Arizona State University Ross-Blakley Law Library user on 11 April 2024 11 of 15 birpublications.org/bjr Br J Radiol;90:20170039 REFERENCES 1. Peterson MS, Baron RL, Rankin SC.

The prognosis of advanced EMPD is not favorable; thus, the development of potential treatments has long been sought. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib and palbociclib have been proven effective against metastatic breast cancer; however, no studies have addressed CDK4/6 inhibitors as an EMPD treatment. We herein examine the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors against an EMPD patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Abemaciclib (50 mg/kg/day) or palbociclib (120 mg/kg/day) was given orally to tumor-bearing NOD/Scid mice over a 3-week period. We also investigated the protein expression levels of CDK4/6 and cyclin D1 through immunohistochemical staining using EMPD clinical samples. Treatment with abemaciclib or palbociclib as a single agent was found to significantly suppress tumor growth in EMPD-PDX. The Ki-67.positive ratio of the treated EMPD-PDX tumors was significantly lower than that of the nontreated tumors. Clinically, the expression levels of CDK4 and cyclin D1 were significantly higher in the EMPD tumor cells than in the normal epidermis. Our results suggest that CDK4/6 inhibitors could be novel and potent therapeutics for the treat.ment of EMPD. KEYWORDS cancer, cyclin, cyclin-dependent kinase, extramammary PagetÕs disease, patient-derived xenograft No standard therapies for advanced EMPD have been established; thus, efforts are needed to develop potential treatment options. Extramammary PagetÕs disease (EMPD) is a rare cutaneous malig-The significance of PDX has been proven in the development of nancy that occurs within the genital epithelium.1 The incidence and treatments for some cancers.6 Patient-derived xenograft models can mortality have been increasing over the last several decades.2 A ret-be established with the transplantation of cancerous cells or tissues rospective study reported that the 5-year overall survival rate for from patientsÕ tumors into immunodeficient mice.

Tumor-bearing NOD/Scid mice were randomized. In the CDK4/6-targeted treatments, abemaciclib (50 mg/kg/day) or palbociclib (120 mg/kg/day) was given orally once a day (n = 3) harboring a pathogenic ERBB2 S310F mutation for which anti-HER2 therapies are effective.7 To the best of our knowledge, this is the only EMPD-PDX model that is currently available in the world. Cyclin-dependent kinases, a family of serine-threonine kinases, play crucial roles in the cell cycle, neural development, and sper.matogenesis.8 Cyclin-dependent kinase 4, and the closely related CDK6, are important in mammalian cell proliferation, where they help to lead the progression of cells into the S phase.9,10 Inhibitors of CDK4/6, such as abemaciclib and palbociclib, have been proven ef.fective as therapeutics against breast cancers.11 These inhibitors are currently available for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer treatment.11 Whole-exome sequencing re.vealed that some EMPD tumors share common genetic alterations with breast cancers12-15; thus, we hypothesize that these drugs could be effective against EMPD tumor cells. No clinical or experimental studies have investigated CDK4/6 inhibitors against EMPD. We herein examine the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors against an EMPD.PDX model, and we investigate the protein expression of CDK4/6 and cyclin D1 using EMPD clinical samples. 2.| MATERIALS.AND.METHODS 2.1 | Reagents.and.Abs The following items were purchased from the indicated sources: Abs against CDK4 (11026-1-AP; Proteintech), CDK6 (ab124821; Abcam), and cyclin D1 (SP1; Invitrogen). Palbociclib was purchased from Sigma (PZ0383), and abemaciclib (LY2835219) was purchased from Adooq BioScience (A12989). These drugs were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma). 2.2.| Patient-.derived.xenografts.from.EMPD We established PDXs from EMPD using Matrigel (BD Biosciences; EMPD-PDX-H1).7 Animal use procedures were approved by the institutional committee of Hokkaido University (approval nos. 19-0015 and 19-0093). NOD/Scid mice were purchased from Clea Japan. All animals used for this study were maintained under pathogen-free conditions. The tumor-transplanted NOD/Scid mice were observed twice a week. The tumors were measured once a week by caliper. Tumor volume was calculated according to the fol.lowing formula: (long axis . short axis2)/2.8 Once the tumor volume reached 500Ð1000 mm3, the EMPD-PDX-H1 tumors were trans.planted into the next generation of NOD/Scid mice. Treatment ex.periments in the present study were undertaken using the fourth to sixth generations. Targeted gene mutation analysis using a compre.hensive cancer panel (Qiagen) revealed neither apparent mutations nor copy number alterations in the CDK4 gene of the EMPD-PDX.7 2.3.| Treatment.experiments.using.CDK4/6.inhibitors Tumor growth curves for all of the EMPD-PDX-H1 tumors were generated by using the kinetic measurement of tumor volume. The tumor volume range of 50Ð100 mm3 in the tumor-bearing NOD/Scid mice was randomized, and treatment experiments were started. All treatment experiments were carried out with a minimum of three mice per condition. Control mice were given 100 .L PBS once a day orally (n = 3). In the CDK4/6-targeted treatments, abemaciclib (50 mg/kg/day) or palbociclib (120 mg/kg/day) was given orally once a day for 3 weeks in accordance with previous studies (Figure 1).16,17 2.4.| Histopathological.analyses Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out on 4-.m-thick formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections.18 Immunostaining was evaluated by the same observer; the total immunostaining score for CDK4 and cyclin D1 was calculated as the sum of proportion scores (0, absent; 1, 0%Ð25%; 2, 25%Ð50%; 3, 50%Ð75%; and 4, 75%Ð100%) and intensity scores (0, absent; 1, faint; 2, moderate; and 3, strong) in accordance with our previous study.19 The proportion of immunore.active cells was determined by counting 100 cells in three randomly chosen fields. 2.5.| Patient.selection Sixty-one skin samples from EMPD patients were immunohisto.chemically assessed. All of the patients had been treated at the Department of Dermatology, Hokkaido University Hospital. The EMPD samples were obtained from patients whose ages ranged from 53 to 94 years (average, 75.0 years, male : female ratio, 36:25). This study was approved by the institutional review board of Hokkaido University Hospital (017-0392). Initial clinical stages and observed time were retrieved from clinical data. The clinical information is summarized in Table S1. The clinical stages of EMPD were assessed in accordance with our previous study.3,19 2.6.| Statistical.analysis Quantitative data are shown as mean ± SD. All statistical analy.ses were calculated using Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation). To evaluate the statistical significance of the treatment experiments, StudentÕs t tests were used to compare tumor volumes between the treatment groups and the control group. At least three independent experiments were carried out for statistical comparison. We used the Steel-Dwass test to assess pairwise comparisons among groups (immunohistochemistry). All analyses were carried out with a P <.05 level of significance unless otherwise indicated. The correlation be.tween CDK4/cyclin D1 expression levels and clinical information was assessed using SpearmanÕs correlation coefficient by rank test, as in our previous study.19 3.| RESULTS 3.1 | Cyclin-.dependent.kinase.4/6.inhibitors.suppress.tumor.growth.in.EMPD-.PDX First, we investigated the protein expression of CDK4 and CDK6 in EMPD-PDX using anti-CDK4 and CDK6 Abs. The tumor cells in EMPD-PDX were positive for CDK4 but negative for CDK6, which is consistent with the original metastatic tumor (Figure 2). Based on these results, we undertook therapeutic intervention using anti.CDK4/6 inhibitors to investigate whether EMPD-PDX-H1 responds to such therapies. The CDK4/6 inhibitors, abemaciclib and palboci.clib, were found to suppress tumor progression (Figure 3). We as.sessed the extracted tumors by H&E and Ki-67 staining. In the Ki-67 staining, the positive ratio was significantly lower for the treated EMPD-PDX-H1 tumors than for the nontreated tumors (Figure S1). There were no noticeable side-effects, including fatigue, diarrhea, or body weight loss, during the observation period. These results FIGURE.2.Histopathological and immunochemical manifestations in extramammary PagetÕs disease patient-derived xenograft (EMPD.PDX) and the original metastatic tumor (lymph node [LN]).

Immunohistochemically, the expression levels of CDK4 in EMPD tumor cells were higher than in normal epidermal keratino.cytes or adnexal epithelium (hair follicles and sweat glands; Figure 4, *P < .01). The expression levels of CDK4 in lymph node metastatic tumor cells were also higher than in normal epidermis. These results are consistent with the previous study by Urata et al.20 Next, we assessed the expression levels of cyclin D1 in EMPD tumors. The EMPD primary tumor cells showed higher cyclin D1 expression lev.els than normal epidermis (Figure S2). To examine the clinical sig.nificance of high expression levels of CDK4 and cyclin D1 in EMPD, we assessed the correlations between immunostaining results and clinical information. No correlation was observed between CDK4/ cyclin D1 expression and clinical stage in EMPD (data not shown). 4.| DISCUSSION Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors are powerful therapeutics for cancer treatment, especially breast cancer. In preclinical models, CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown positive results against many kinds of tumors, including colon cancer, glioblastomas, prostate carcino.mas, sarcomas, pancreatic adenocarcinomas, melanomas, and non.small-cell lung cancer.11 Based on the preclinical evidence, clinical trials using CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib and abemaciclib) as single agents have been undertaken as a treatment for solid tumors, in.cluding sarcomas, thymic epithelial tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, brain tumors, teratomas, and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.11 In the dermatologic field, clinical investigations of the concurrent inhibition of MEK and CDK4/6 have been carried out using data from patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma.21 It is our hope that in several years the results of ongoing clinical trials will provide novel treatment options for many kinds of solid tumors. As the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibition is limited by resistance mechanisms, combined therapeutic strategies have been studied. Through in vitro and in vivo investigations, some of the molecular mechanisms associated with resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition have been elucidated.22 In breast cancer, the HER2 pathway has been thought to be a resistance mechanism, as HER2 activation correlates with resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors.22 Additionally, activation of the CDK4 pathway contributes to resistance to HER2-directed ther.apies.23 It has been reported that CDK4/6 inhibitors and anti-HER2 therapies have synergistic effects on model mice with breast can.cer.24 Furthermore, recent clinical studies found the combination therapy of CDK4/6 inhibitors and trastuzumab had promising re.sults for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancers.24,25 The ex.pression levels of CDK4 and cyclin D1 are high in EMPD (Figure 4); furthermore, pathogenic ERBB2 mutations and/or higher expression levels of HER2 protein are detected in some EMPD cases. In light of the above, not only could CDK4/6-targeted therapies be promising as single-agent therapies against advanced EMPD with HER2 acti.vation, but they could also be promising therapies in combination with anti-HER2 Abs. Our study currently has the limitation that we have established only one EMPD-PDX model,7 and we used it to evaluate the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors. We are now working on establishing other EMPD-PDX models and will verify our results in the future. In conclusion, the present study indicates that CDK4/6 inhibitors suppress tumor growth in EMPD-PDX, suggesting that these drugs could be promising treatment options for advanced EMPD patients. DISCLOSURE The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest. ORCID Shinya Kitamura https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4232-2943 Teruki Yanagi https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2196-7600 Hideyuki Ujiie https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3489-5418 REFERENCES 1.

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) is a rare skin neoplasm that has not been characterized on a molecular basis. Aim. To assess expression proÞles of Hedgehog (HH) signalling molecules in MAC and control tumours. Methods. Immunohistochemistry was performed for Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Indian Hedgehog (IHH), Patched 1 (PTCH1) and Smoothened (SMO) on patient MAC tissue (n = 26) and control tumour tissue, including syringoma (SyG; n = 11), tricho.epithelioma (TE; n = 11) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC; n = 12) tissues. Results. Patched 1 and SMO immunoreactivity was signiÞcantly higher in BCC than in SyG, TE or MAC (P < 0.001 and P < 0.03, respectively). The highest IHH expression was observed in BCC and TE compared with SyG and MAC (P < 0.04). Notably, the highest SHH protein expression was observed in SyG compared with MAC, TE and even BCC (P < 0.001). In patients with MAC, SMO immunoreactivity signiÞcantly (r = 0.51; P < 0.01) correlated with PTCH1 expression. Further correla.tion studies did not show signiÞcant associations between the HH expression mark.ers assessed (P > 0.05). Conclusion. Our results indicate that alterations of the HH signalling are unlikely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of MAC, which is in contrast to the mor.phologically similar BCC and TE. Our observation provides additional information to the limited molecular pathology knowledge on this rare tumour. Introduction Microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) is an infrequent skin tumour that commonly occurs on the face of elderly white patients.

Diagnosis of MAC may be challenging as superÞcial biopsies often reveal only benign Þndings such as SyG. MAC is locally aggressive and rarely metastasizes. Patients are treated with surgery, which may need to be followed by radiation in a small sub.set. Patients with MAC have an excellent 10-year overall survival rate of 86%. Poorly differentiated/ anaplastic MAC is associated with more aggressive dis.ease compared with well-differentiated tumours. The pathogenesis of MAC is based on pilar and eccrine dif.ferentiation.1Ð4 To date, however, there are only lim.ited data on the oncogenic pathways driving MAC. Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ced/article/46/6/1052/6598452 by Arizona State University Ross-Blakley Law Library user on 11 April 2024 1052 Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021) 46, pp1052Ð1057 » 2021 The Authors.

Gambichler et al. The Hedgehog (HH) signalling cascade is one of the main developmental pathways in human embryogenesis and organogenesis. It is well known that reactivation of the HH pathway later in life can lead to the development of cancers.5,6 In mammals, three HH homologs have been identiÞed: Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Indian Hedge.hog (IHH) and Desert Hedgehog. HH proteins bind to their receptor Patched (PTCH) to interfere with its inhibiting function for Smoothened (SMO).5,6 It is well known that both BCC and TE are associated with patho.logical alterations in the HH signalling pathway.5,7,8 As both tumour types are phenotypically similar to MAC we hypothesized that the HH pathway might also be altered in MAC.1Ð8 We performed a study to determine the protein expression proÞles of HH signalling mole.cules in MACs. Methods The study was approved by the local ethics review board (#4749Ð13). Informed consent for use of tissue had been obtained on a routine basis from patients. Tissues Archived formalin-Þxed parafÞn wax-embedded (FFPE) MAC tissues were collected in three dermatology cen.tres in Germany (Bochum, Duisburg, Hornheide). Diag.nosis of all tumours was conÞrmed by at least two of three senior dermatohistopathologists (MS, JS, HJS). As controls, we included SyG, TE and BCC tissues. Immunohistochemistry of tumour samples Staining for SHH, IHH, PTCH1 and SMO was performed as follows: 4-.m sections from FFPE blocks were mounted onto microscope slides (Dako IHC Microscope Slides; Dako, Hamburg, Germany) and stored for 30 min in a humid chamber at 80 ¡C. Sections were dewaxed and heated in a target retrieval solution (EnVision FLEX; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at either low pH (SHH, IHH) or high pH (SMO, PTCH) for 20 min. Blocking of nonspeciÞc staining was accom.plished with a commercial blocking agent (Dual Endogenous Enzyme Block S2003; Dako) for 5 min. For immunostaining, we used rabbit monoclonal anti.bodies against SHH (cat. no. ab53281), IHH (ab52919), SMO (ab72130) and PTCH1 (ab53715) (all Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA). The diluted anti.bodies were incubated at room temperature for either 30 min (SMO 1 : 500 and PTCH1 1 : 200) or 90 min (SHH 1 : 150 and IHH 1 : 250). The following steps of the immunohistochemistry procedures were performed in accordance with the manufacturerÕs recommenda.tions for the system (Dako REAL Detection System K5005; Dako). Visualization of the antigens was achieved by a commercial stain (AP/Permanent Red; Abcam) with haematoxylin for counterstaining. Microscopic evaluation For microscopic analysis, stained slides were scanned at 9 20 magniÞcation (Nanozoomer Whole Slide Scanner; Hamamatsu Photonics, Herrsching am Ammersee, Ger.many) and the images were evaluated using the viewer software (NDP.view2; Hamamatsu Photonics).

Gambichler et al. Results Patients We collected tissues from 26 patients with MAC (11 men, 15 women; median age 75 years, range 35Ð90). As controls, we included tissues from 11 women with SyG (median age 73 years, range 65Ð80), 11 women with TE (median age: 62 years, range 43Ð88) and 12 patients with BCC (6 men, 6 women; median age: 74.5 years, range 46Ð90). Hence, the sex distribution of patients with MAC or BCC differed signiÞcantly (P < 0.05) from those with SyG or TE. Tumours Almost all tumours were located on the head/face (P > 0.05) (Table 1). Immunoreactivity was predomi.nantly observed in the cytosol and/or cell membrane of tumour cells (Fig. 1). As summarized in Table 1, PTCH1 and SMO immunoreactivities were signiÞcantly higher (P < 0.001 and P < 0.03, respectively) in BCC tissues than in SyG, TE or MAC tissues. The highest IHH expression was observed in BCC and TE compared with SyG and MAC (P < 0.04). Notably, SHH protein expression was signiÞcantly higher in SyG than in MAC, TE and even BCC (P = 0.00075). In patients with MAC, immunoreactivity of SMO and PTCH1 were signiÞcantly correlated (r = 0.51; P < 0.01). Immunoreactivity of PTCH1 (P = 0.44), IHH (P = 0.43), SSH (P = 0.69) and SMO (P = 0.66) was not signiÞcantly different between normal epidermis and MAC tissue (Fig. 2). Further correlation studies did not show signiÞcant associations between the HH expression markers assessed (P > 0.05). Discussion Owing to the rarity of MACs, the molecular character.istics remain almost undeÞned to date. Wohlfahrt et al.9 previously performed cytogenetic analysis of a MAC and found a clonal 6q deletion as the sole kary.otypic change in this tumour. The authors suggested that this observation, together with the histopathologi.cal similarities between sweat gland tumours, such as MACs and salivary gland tumours, emphasize the his.togenetic relationships between these tumour types. Moreover, Chen and Laber 10 reported the Þrst case of metastatic MAC; in this case, DNA sequencing indi.cated a p53 mutation and chromosomal losses in the CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes. The largest molecular proÞling study on MACs was recently reported by 1056 Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021) 46, pp1052Ð1057 Chan et al.,11 who characterized 18 MACs by next-generation sequencing of the coding sequence of > 400 cancer-relevant genes, and proposed that MACs are molecularly heterogeneous tumours, with inacti.vated p53 or activated Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signalling in a subset.11 However, unlike most other ultraviolet (UV) radiation-related non-melanoma skin cancers, most MACs lack evidence of UV damage and hence more probably orig.inate from a UV-protected progenitor cell population in the dermis. Smith et al.12 observed only sparse p53 protein expression in MACs, although MACs arise very frequently in chronically UV-exposed skin sites.12 Based on morphological similarities to BCC and TE, we hypothesized that MACs may also be driven by alter.ations in HH signalling pathway. However, our data clearly demonstrate that the protein expression of the HH signalling pathway molecules is not signiÞcantly altered in MACs, particularly compared with BCC. This observation is in line with the aforementioned MAC data of Chan et al.,11 who did not Þnd gene mutations in the HH pathway. An interesting observation in our study was the signiÞcant positive correlation of PTCH1 and SMO protein expression in MACs. Similarly, Cavic.chioli Buim et al.13 investigated the mRNA expression of SHH, SMO, PTCH1 and GLI1 in 30 oral squamous cell carcinomas by quantitative real-time PCR, and revealed strong correlation between PTCH1 and SMO expression. PTCH1 functions as a negative regulator of the HH signalling pathway by repressing downstream signalling from SMO. As a direct target of the GLI tran.scription factors, high levels of PTCH1 are linked to ele.vated HH pathway activation, where PTCH1 functions in a negative feedback loop to attenuate HH signalling. Another interesting observation in our study, which seems have been unreported to date, was the signiÞ.cantly increased SHH expression in SyG compared with BCC, MAC and TE. However, the increase in SHH was not associated with overexpression of the other HH molecules such as PTCH1 and SMO. Conclusion Our results indicate that alterations of HH signalling are not likely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of MACs. Our observation increases the still limited molec.14,15ular pathology knowledge of this rare tumour. Acknowledgement This work is part of the doctoral thesis of I.

The tumor typically presents as a slowly growing, firm plaque on the trunk of young adults. The cause of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is not clearly understood. Studies have implicated a chromosomal translocation, resulting in the fusion protein COL1A1-PDGFB, which promotes tumor growth through the overproduction of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Diagnosis is made via skin biopsy. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is considered an intermediate-grade malignancy with a low likelihood of metastasis but a high local recurrence rate. Given its propensity for a subclinical extension, the optimal treatment modality for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), a surgical technique that allows complete margin assessment and tissue preservation.Alternatively, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans can be treated with wide local excision. The chemotherapeutic agent imatinib mesylate is currently FDA-approved for adults with unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.[1][2][3][4][5] Etiology https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513305/?report=printable 4/11/24, 3:24 PM DermatoÞbrosarcoma Protuberans -StatPearls -NCBI Bookshelf The mesenchymal tumor is thought to originate from a dermal stem cell or undifferentiated mesenchymal cell with fibroblastic, muscular, and neurologic features. The cause of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans unknown, though a proposed risk factor includes injury to the skin in the affected location. Occurrences within preexisting scars and tattoos have been reported. Epidemiology Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare tumor with an incidence rate of 0.8 to 4.5 cases per million persons per year. It accounts for between 1% and 6% of all soft tissue sarcomas and 18% of all cutaneous soft tissue sarcomas. The pigmented variant, known as a Bednar tumor, and the fibrosarcomatous variant account for less than 5% and 5% to 15% of all dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans cases, respectively. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans occurs most often in adults in the third to fifth decades of life but has been reported in all age groups, including congenital presentations. Studies disagree as to whether there is a slight female or male predominance. During pregnancy, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans can exhibit accelerated growth. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, particularly Bednar tumors, occur most frequently in black patients. Pathophysiology Studies have shown that dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans demonstrates the chromosomal translocation t(17;22) (q22;q13) betweenchromosome17andchromosome22,whichisthoughttobekeyinthetumorÕspathogenesis. The chromosomal translocation leads to the fusion of platelet-derived growth factor-beta polypeptide gene (PDGFB) and collagen type 1A1 gene (COL1A1). The gene rearrangement upregulates PDGFB, resulting in overproduction of PDGF, continuous autocrine activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRb), cellular proliferation, and tumor formation. This chromosomal translocation is present in over 90% of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. In cases without the COL1A1/PDGFB translocation, a different chromosomal translocation still involving PDGFB on chromosome 22 has been demonstrated. Histopathology DFSPis poorly circumscribed and usually involves dermis and subcutis. Rare cases can be limited to the dermis. DFSPis considered an intermediate tumor between a benign dermatofibroma and a frank fibrosarcoma due to the possibility of having distant metastasis and aggressive local invasion. Transformation to a high-grade sarcoma is extremely rare. The overlying epidermis does not show any atypical histological features, but macroscopically the skin appears greyish or lightly pigmented. Tumor cells are arranged in a storiform or intersecting pattern, parallel to the epidermal surface. DFSPis constituted by spindle cells with little pleomorphism and scant cytoplasm. Mitoses are present, but there is no striking mitotic activity, and atypical mitosis is rare.Amitotic count that reaches 10/10 HPF and tumor size correlates with metastatic spread [6]. The cells are surrounded by collagenous stroma, sometimes associated with hyaline or myxoid changes. Infiltration to the underlying tissue (subcutis, fascia, muscle, periosteum) is a common feature, usually with neoplastic tentacles that shape a characteristic honeycomb appearance. Necrosis is uncommon. Fibrosarcomatous transformation is seen as an expansive tumor with fascicular and herringbone pattern, atypical cytological features; it can happen in about a fifth of all DFSP, ranging 10 to 20%, arising in all histologic subtypes.An immunohistochemical panel is useful for diagnosing DFSP. CD34 is commonly positive (80Ð100% of cases), while FXIIIa, SMA, desmin, S100, and keratins are negative. All DFSPshow a recurrent translocation: t(17;22)(q22;q13) resulting in COL1A1-PDGFB fusion. This constitutively activates the tyrosine kinase PDGF-B receptor and leads to altered cell cycle control and tumor spread. Differential diagnosis of DFSPinclude: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513305/?report=printable 4/11/24, 3:24 PM DermatoÞbrosarcoma Protuberans -StatPearls -NCBI Bookshelf Cellular fibrous histiocytoma/dermatofibroma, negative for CD34 and positive for FXIIIa; Solitary fibrous tumor: CD34 and STAT-6 positive, has a typical NAB2-STAT6 gene fusion; Spindle cell lipoma: S100 positive Angiosarcoma: positive for CD31 and ERG Peripheral nerve sheath tumors that express S100, SOX-10, GFAP; Spindle cell melanoma that expresses S100, MART1/MELANA Angiomyxoma, Myxoid sarcoma Synovial sarcoma is rarely positive for CD34 but is positive forTLE1 and EMA. Sarcomatoid carcinoma: pleomorphic variant of undifferentiated carcinomas and is CD34-negative, keratin-positive. History and Physical Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans typically presents as an asymptomatic, skin-colored to red-brown indurated plaque, which eventually develops multiple raised violaceus to red-brown nodules. They grow slowly and can reach several centimeters in diameter. The atrophic variant presents as a violaceous plaque that may resemble morphea or scar. The tumor, particularly in the early stages, can resemble a keloid or dermatofibroma and is often misdiagnosed.As they grow larger, some can ulcerate and become painful. The majority of DFSPs occur on the trunk (50%), followed by the extremities (35%) and then head and neck (15%). The shoulder and pelvic region are particularly characteristic areas for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans usually extends into the subcutaneous fat but rarely involves the fascia, muscle, or bone unless it is longstanding or recurrent. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is known to have relentless growth with asymmetric, root-like projections which cannot be appreciated on clinical exam. Thus, local recurrence following excision is common. Distant metastasis is rare, occurring in 1% to 4% of cases and usually only after multiple local recurrences. The lung is the most common site of metastasis via hematogenous spread. The regional lymph nodes are rarely involved. The fibrosarcomatous variant of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans has a higher risk of local recurrence (14% to 52%) and distant metastases (8% to 29%). Evaluation Diagnosis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is made with a skin biopsy, preferably an incisional or excisional biopsy.Afull history and physical exam, including lymph node examination, should be completed. Some sources suggest obtaining chest imaging to evaluate for any metastatic disease before treatment, though this is not currently a general recommendation.Apreoperative MRI, though not necessary, is sometimes performed to help define tumor extension before surgery.[7][8][9][10] Treatment / Management The treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is surgical removal, ideally with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), a surgical technique that ensures complete histopathologic margin control at the time of surgery. MMS is preferred over wide local excision as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans tends to have an unpredictable subclinical extension. In select situations or when Mohs micrographic surgery is not available, wide local excision may be performed with 2-to 4 cm margins. However, local recurrence is relatively common with wide local excision even with clear surgical margins. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans treated with wide local excision has a recurrence rate https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513305/?report=printable 4/11/24, 3:24 PM DermatoÞbrosarcoma Protuberans -StatPearls -NCBI Bookshelf of about 7.3% compared to a recurrence rate of about 1% when treated with MMS. If feasible, modified wide local excision with horizontal sectioning, as opposed to the usual histologic vertical processing (Ôbread-loafingÓ), and detailed mapping can be performed to decrease the likelihood of local recurrence.As spread to the lymph nodes is extremely rare, regional node dissection is not recommended. The chemotherapy agent imatinib mesylate, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can be used for recurrent, unresectable, and metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans in adults. Imatinib mesylate competitively inhibitsATPbinding to the PDGF-beta receptor, a tyrosine kinase. This slows down kinase activity, limiting the growth of the tumor, and promoting apoptosis. Patients with the t(17;22) translocation show a greater response to imatinib mesylate, and thus screening for this translocation should be performed before initiating therapy. Testing for the translocation can be performed using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT.PCR). Side effects of imatinib mesylate include gastrointestinal upset, edema, fatigue, anemia, and rash. The majority of patients with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans with the translocation respond favorably to imatinib mesylate therapy, with studies suggesting a response rate of approximately 65%. The duration of therapy varies. Some sources recommend 6 months of therapy, but this may be extended if needed.Alternatively, radiation therapy may also be used for unresectable or recurrent tumors, and adjuvant radiation may decrease the risk of local recurrence.[11][12] As local recurrence is common, patients require close clinical follow-up after completing treatment. The risk of recurrence is highest in the first 3 years after treatment, and thus patients should be evaluated every 3 to 6 months during this time and at least annually thereafter. Some sources advocate baseline and serial chest CTscans, especially in the case of fibrosarcomatous dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, which has a higher risk of local recurrence and metastasis. Otherwise, routine imaging is not required unless there are symptoms to suggest metastasis. Differential Diagnosis Cutaneous melanoma Dermatofibroma Dermatologic metastatic carcinoma Epidermal inclusion cyst Keloid scar Morphea Prognosis The overall prognosis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is good, with a 10-year survival rate of 99.1%.As metastasis is rare, morbidity due to local recurrence is a more common issue.Age older than 50 is a risk factor for local recurrence. Patients with metastatic disease live on average about 2 years after the time of diagnosis.Ahigh mitotic index, increased cellularity, black race, male sex, and location on the head, neck, or limb are risk factors for higher mortality rates. Complications While the prognosis for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is quite good, the main complication is the rare instances where it can metastasize. Other complications center around post-surgical scarring and cosmesis. Deterrence and Patient Education Patients must understand that post-treatment, continued visits to a dermatologist are crucial. When dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans returns, it is usually within 3 years; they should schedule an examination https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513305/?report=printable 4/11/24, 3:24 PM DermatoÞbrosarcoma Protuberans -StatPearls -NCBI Bookshelf quarterly until that time.Afterward, assuming no recurrence, annual visits are sufficient.[13] Pearls and Other Issues In cases of advanced or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, coordinated care with multiple specialties is crucial.Adermatologic surgeon, ideally a Mohs micrographic surgeon, should be involved in the surgical treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The diagnosis and management of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans require an interprofessional team that consists of an oncologist, surgeon, radiologist, radiation therapist, and physical therapy. The treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is surgical removal. The key is to remove the entire lesion with clear margins. Local recurrences are very common when margins are positive. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans does not respond well to chemotherapy or radiation.All patients need long-term follow-up with imaging studies because recurrences are known to occur. The prognosis for patients with completely excised lesions is good.[14] [Level 5] Review Questions Access free multiple choice questions on this topic. Comment on this article. References 1. NeffR,CollinsR,BackesF.

Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a useful marker, providing information on platelet function and diameter. OBJECTIVE: To investigate c-Kit expression and intensity in patients with KaposiÕs sarcoma (KS) and to investigate the relation between Ki-67 proliferation and MPV. METHODS: A total of 32 patients, diagnosed with classic cutaneous KS, were included in this study. We reevaluated the his.topathological reports with the preparations, confirmed the diagnosis and then determined the patientsÕ histopathological stages. c-Kit expression and Ki-67 proliferation were investigated immunohistochemically in KS cases, while MPV in all cases was checked. RESULTS: Although c-Kit expression was detected in 22 cases (68.8%), it was not expressed in 10 cases (31.2%). We detected 8 cases with + (25%), 6 with ++ (18.8%) and 8 with +++ (25%). Ki-67 expression was 5.0% (min-max 1.0-20.0). Relapse was ob.served in 5 cases (15.6%) out of 32. There was positive correlation between c-Kit expression and MPV (rs=0.598, p<0.001), and between c-Kit intensity and MPV (rs=0.588, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: c-Kit is highly positive in KS. c-Kit positivity indicates a high risk of tumor growth, invasion and relapse. Fur.thermore, c-Kit expression stimulates megakaryocytes to release young and large thrombocytes into the periphery. Thus, high MPV, c-Kit expression and immunostaining intensity indicate high invasion and relapse in KS subjects.

Although it can be observed in all or.gans, it presents predominantly in mucocutaneous tissues.1 There are 4 types with principally classified, defined according to histo.pathological characteristics (new vascular proliferation, erythrocyte extravasation, edema and mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltra.tion): classic, African (endemic), iatrogenic and acquired immu.nodeficiency syndrome-related.2 In practice, KS generally presents as one or multiple, asymptomatic, red-purple or brown patches, plaques or nodular skin lesions in the lower extremities.3 C-Kit is involved in cell signal transduction in many different cell types and it encodes tyrosine kinase receptor (CD117). Furthermore, c-Kit is a mutagenic effective proto-oncogene with a stem-cell factor (SCF) as a ligand, and it leads to tumor growth through impairment of cellular growth regulation.4 In humans, it is localized in the q11-q22 region of the fourth chromosome. As a member of the platelet-de.rived growth factor (PDGF) family, c-Kit plays a key role in the tum.origenesis of KS.5 In the literature c-Kit expression has been investi.gated but different results have been reported.6-8 Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a simple, inexpensive and easily applied test. Additionally, it provides information on throm.bocyte functions and diameters, and is a good indicator for throm.bocytes activation.9 A high MPV indicates the presence of large and active thrombocytes in the periphery.

A total of 32 patients (21 males, 11 females) were included in the study; they had been diagnosed with classic cutaneous KS in the pathology department between 2010 and 2014. The data obtained during recurrence in patients with relapse were only used their first data to the statistics. Histopathological reports with the prepara.tions were reevaluated, the diagnosis was confirmed and the pa.tientsÕ histopathological stages were then determined. The subjects had no history of human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection, organ transplantation or immunosuppressive treatment. Paraffin-embedded blocks of KS subjects were cut into 3 micrometer sections and put on positively charged slides for immu.nohistochemical study. CD117 (ready-to-use mouse monoclonal an.tibody, Biogenex, Fremont, CA, USA) and Ki-67 (ready-to-use mouse monoclonal antibody, Biogenex, Fremont, CA, USA) primary anti.bodies were applied to the sections for immunohistochemical study. The following were applied for the immunohistochemical staining system: biotin-free, HRP multimer-based, hydrogen peroxide sub.strate and 3,3Õ-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) chromo.gen containing ultraViewª Universal DAB Detection Kit (Catalog number 760-091, Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ,USA), and a fully automated immunohistochemistry staining device (Ventana Bench Mark XT, Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA). Im.munohistochemical staining included deparaffinization and antigen revealing procedures, which were carried out using Bench Mark XT fully automatic immunohistochemical staining devices. Primer anti.bodies CD117 and Ki-67 were only manually dripped at 37¡C and in.cubated for 30 minutes. MayerÕs hematoxylin was used as a contrast stain and the sections were evaluated blindly by 2 pathologists via Olympus BX51 light microscopy. Basal keratinocytes were used as a positive control for CD117 and Ki-67. Membranous or cytoplasmic staining of the tumor cells were positive > 1% for CD117. Moreover, CD117 staining and intensity were evaluated semi-quantitatively for all the subjects. The extent of CD117 staining was accepted as -, no positive or < 1% positive cells;+, (10% of cells), ++, (>10and <50% of cells), and +++ (>50% of cells).8 CD117 intensity was scored as 0 (none), 1+ (weak), 2+ (moderate) and 3+ (strong).14 Nuclear staining in tumor cells was considered positive for Ki-67. The hematologic parameters were studied using the Abbott Cell Dyn Ruby analyzer (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA). The results are expressed as a median (minimum-maxi.mum) or a percentage where appropriate. Furthermore, the entire statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS for Windows (version 17; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) program. Non-numerical data such as gender, location and histologic stage were compared using the chi-square test orFisherÕs exact test(when atleast25%ofthe cells had expectedfrequencies ofunder 5,FisherÕs exact test was used). In this study, the Mann-Whitney U test or Kru.skalÐWallis test (when the number of groups had frequencies of above 2, the KruskalÐWallis test was performed) were used to com.pare numerical data because of their non-normal distribution and the small number of subjects. SpearmanÕs formula was applied for correlation analysis. A P level of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS The lesions were localized as follows: 20 (62.5%) on the legs, 8 (25%) on the arms and 4 (12.5%) on the head and neck (H&N). While the vast majority of cases were at the nodular stage (53.1%), 31.3% of them were at the plaque stage, and the remaining 15.6% were at the patch stage. c-Kit expression was not detected in 10 cas.es (31.2%), 8 (25%) cases had +, 6 (18.8%) cases had ++ and 8 (25%) cases had +++. Furthermore, c-Kit immunostaining intensity was + for 7 cases (21.9%), ++ for 7 cases (21.9%) and +++ for 8 cases (25%) (Figure 1). Ki-67 expression was 5.0% (min-max 1.0-20.0) (Figure 1). Relapse was detected in 5 (15.6%) cases out of 32; c-Kit expression levels in relapse cases comprised 2 cases with +, 1 case with ++ and 2 cases with +++. All sociodemographic data are shown in table 1. The cases (31.2%) with negative c-Kit expression (CN) were compared with those (68.8%) involving positive c-Kit expression (CP). The MPV level of the CN group was 7.0 (6.0-10.4) fL, whereas it A BC An Bras Dermatol. 2016;91(4):430-5. 432 Sehitoglu I, Bedir R, Cure E, Cure MC, Yuce S, Dilek N was 8.4 (6.3-11.2) fL (p=0.007) in the CP group. While 5 cases showed relapse in the CP group, no relapses were noted in the CN group (p=0.155). However, there was no statistical significance. Other data revealed no significance. All the results are displayed in table 2. Ki-67 expression in the plaque group was significantly high.er than in the patch group (p=0.042). The white blood cell level of the plaque group was significantly lower than in the patch group (p=0.037). Interestingly, the Ki-67 level of the plaque group was higher than in the nodular group. Nevertheless, it was not statisti.cally significant. The MPV levels of the patch and nodular groups correlated positively with increases in the disease stage. However, no statistical significance was noted. All the results are shown in table 3. Relapse was high in cases involving leg lesions. The MPV level and Ki-67 expression of subjects with relapse were higher than in subjects without relapse, although they were not significant. All the results are shown in table 4. Comparison of Ki-67 according to gender revealed that while it was 10.0 (3.0-20.0)% in females, it was 4.0 (1.0-20.0)% in males (p=0.013). However, c-Kit expression, MPV and other param.eters entailed no gender difference. c-Kit expression correlated positively with both MPV (rs=0.602, p<0.001) and c-Kit intensity (rs=0.991, p<0.001). There were no positive or negative correlations between c-Kit expression and the other parameters (age, rs=0.102, p=0.547; stage rs=0.155, p=0.361; ki67 rs=0.300, p=0.072; white blood cell counts rs=0.146, p=0.388; hemoglobin rs=0.124, p=0.465; platelets rs=0.199, p=0.239, respectively). Further, c-Kit intensity correlated positively with MPV (rs=0.599, p<0.001). There were no positive or negative cor.relations between c-Kit intensity and the other parameters (age, rs=0.116, p=0.494; stage rs=0.137, p=0.418; ki67 rs=0.296, p=0.075; white blood cell counts rs=0.173, p=0.305; hemoglobin rs=0.142, p=0.401; platelets rs=0.226, p=0.179, respectively). TABLE 1: Sociodemographical data, c-Kit staining and relapse in classic KaposiÕs sarcoma cases Patient Age Gender Location Histological stage c-Kit expression c-Kit intensity Ki-67(%) Relapse 1	  55	  M	  LEG	  NODULAR	  +	  +	  5	  +  2	  88	  M	  LEG	  NODULAR	  0	  0	  2	  3	  83	  M	  ARM	  NODULAR	  ++	  ++	  3	  4	  67	  F	  LEG	  PATCH	  +++	  +++	  5	  5	  62	  M	  ARM	  PATCH	  0	  0	  1	  6	  71	  M	  ARM	  PATCH	  +	  +	  2	  7	  84	  F	  ARM	  PLAQUE	  0	  0	  10	  8	  59	  M	  H&N	  PATCH	  0	  0	  5	  9	  81	  F	  H&N	  NODULAR	  +	  +	  3	  10	  76	  M	  LEG	  PLAQUE	  +	  +	  7	  11	  87	  F	  LEG	  NODULAR	  0	  0	  10	  12	  80	  M	  ARM	  PATCH	  +	  +	  3	  +  13	  78	  M	  LEG	  NODULAR	  +++	  +++	  3	  14	  85	  F	  LEG	  NODULAR	  +++	  +++	  8	  +  15	  95	  M	  LEG	  NODULAR	  +++	  +++	  20	  16	  78	  M	  LEG	  NODULAR	  +	  +	  5	  17	  61	  M	  LEG	  NODULAR	  0	  0	  7	  18	  88	  M	  ARM	  PLAQUE	  0	  0	  15	  19	  97	  F	  LEG	  PLAQUE	  +++	  +++	  20	  +  20	  68	  F	  LEG	  PLAQUE	  +++	  +++	  10	  21	  64	  M	  LEG	  PLAQUE	  0	  0	  4	  22	  51	  F	  ARM	  PLAQUE	  ++	  ++	  10	  23	  65	  M	  H&N	  NODULAR	  +++	  +++	  15	  24	  81	  M	  LEG	  PLAQUE	  +	  +	  1	  25	  81	  M	  LEG	  PLAQUE	  +	  ++	  4	  26	  81	  M	  LEG	  NODULAR	  ++	  ++	  4	  +  27	  98	  F	  LEG	  PLAQUE	  ++	  ++	  20	  28	  42	  M	  ARM	  NODULAR	  ++	  ++	  10	  29	  84	  F	  LEG	  NODULAR	  0	  0	  10	  30	  80	  F	  LEG	  NODULAR	  0	  0	  5	  31	  59	  M	  LEG	  NODULAR	  ++	  ++	  3	  32	  74	  M	  H&N	  NODULAR	  +++	  +++	  5	  Abbreviation: H&N, head and neck.  An Bras Dermatol. 2016;91(4):430-5.  Evaluation of the relationship between c-Kit expression and mean platelet volume in classic KaposiÕs sarcoma TABLE 2: Relationship between c-Kit expression and clinicopathological, hematologic parameters Age (year) (median [min-max])  c-Kit negative (n=10) 82.0 (59.0-88.0)  c-Kit positive (n=22) 78.0 (42.0-98.0)  P value 0.654***  Gender (n,%) Male Female  6 (60%) 4 (40%)  15 (68.18%) 7 (31.82%)  0.703**  Location (n,%) Arm Leg Head and neck  3 (30%) 6 (60%) 1 (10%)  5 (22.72%) 14 (63.64%) 3 (13.64%)  0.639*  Histological stage (n,%) Patch Plaque Nodular  2 (20%) 3 (30%) 5 (50%)  3 (13.64%) 7 (31.82%) 12 (54.54%)  0.703*  Relapse (n,%) Negative Positive  10 (100%) 0 (0%)  17 (77.28%) 5 (22.72%)  0.155**  Ki-67 (%) (median [min-max]) Mean platelet volume(fL) (median [min-max]) Platelets (.109/L) (median [min-max]) White blood cell (.109/L) (median [min-max]) Hemoglobin (g/dL) (median [min-max])  6.0 (1.0-15.0) 7.0 (6.0-10.4) 244.5 (171.0-341.0) 6.8 (3.5-10.6) 13.8 (11.0-16.8)  5.0 (1.0-20.0) 8.4 (6.3-11.2) 228.5 (132.0-420.0) 6.5 (4.2-11.3) 13.6 (9.8-16.2)  0.886*** 0.007*** 0.339*** 0.903*** 0.919***  *p value was calculated by Chi square test;

The MPV level of individ.uals with positive c-Kit expression was higher than in those with negative c-Kit expression. Ki-67 percentages were similar in both positive and negative groups. Whereas the Ki-67 percentage was significantly higher at the plaque stage than the patch stage, it was higher than at the nodular stage. However, it was not statistically significant. The MPV level was found to increase steadily with the stage, yet it was statistically insignificant. Ki-67 percentages and MPV levels in relapse patients were insignificantly higher than in those without relapse. c-Kit expression in KS patients has been reported in differ.ent ranges by a limited number of studies. While Miettinen et al. reported a c-Kit expression rate of 15.3 % (13 cases) in KS, whereas Sarlomo-Rikala et al. reported no c-Kit expression in 7 cases.6,15 How.ever, both studies investigated a limited number of KS cases. Panta.nowitz et al. also found that c-Kit expression was not linked to histo.pathological stage or tumor localization. However, they reported a c-Kit expression of 56% in classic KS cases.7 Only 5 cases were inves.tigated in the Pantanowitz et al. study. In a larger study, Kandemir et al. investigated 35 KS cases and uncovered a c-Kit expression of 62.8%. Reactivity was +1 (n=16), +2 (n=2), +3 (n=4). Additionally, they reported c-Kit immunostaining to be 60% at the patch stage, 66.6% at the plaque stage and 63% at the nodular stage. They found that both c-Kit expression and immunostaining intensity were unre.lated to histopathological stage.8 In our study, out of 32 cases, c-Kit expression emerged in a range of 68.8%. In the three other studies, a low number of cases may lead to bias. However, the number of KS cases in our study is similar to the study of Kandemir et al. and both of the studies have got large population; therefore, both of the stud.ies resultsÕ confirm each other.8 Like Pantanowitz et al., we found that c-Kit expression was not linked to histopathological stage or tumor localization.7 Unlike the other studies, the relapse rate for KS in our study was 15.6%. Curiously, all patients with relapse had pos.itive c-Kit expression, while cases with negative c-kit expression did not entail relapses. Nevertheless, there was no relationship between c-Kit intensity and relapse. c-Kit is a member of the tyrosine kinase family and its pos.itivity indicates indirectly the use of tyrosine kinase pathway in tumor growth and invasion.16,17 Interestingly, although it was not statistically significant, MPV levels were higher in relapse cases. Furthermore, while MPV levels were low in cases with negative c-Kit, they were remarkably high in cases with c-Kit expression. The MPV level indicates young and large thrombocytes in the periph.ery. These thrombocytes release many aggregator substances that lead to arterial and venous thrombosis. c-Kit expression stimulates megakaryocytes, therefore we might have found high correlation between c-Kit expression and MPV.18 Equally, PDGF is a factor re.leased mostly from thrombocytes and it is a member of the tyrosine kinase family.19 PDGF production contributes to both the develop.ment and invasion of the tumor.20 We speculate that the presence of young and large thrombocytes in the periphery reflect indirectly the expression of both c-Kit and PDGF. This may be related to the strong An Bras Dermatol. 2016;91(4):430-5. Evaluation of the relationship between c-Kit expression and mean platelet volume in classic KaposiÕs sarcoma association between c-Kit expression and MPV level, a finding of our study.

But no relationship has been established between c-Kit expression and c-Kit immunostaining intensity. Com.pared with cases without relapse, those involving relapse entailed positive c-Kit, high MPV and high Ki-67 proliferation. CONCLUSION C-Kit positivity is extremely high in KS. The presence of c-Kit positivity increases the risk of tumor growth, invasion and relapse. As c-Kit is a member of the tyrosine kinase family, its ex.pression simulates megakaryopoiesis, leading to the production of young and large thrombocytes in the periphery. Thus, a high MPV level, c-Kit expression and immunostaining intensity in KS cases may reflect invasion and relapse. Ki-67 indicates cell proliferation. According to our results, Ki-67 proliferation in KS was under 10% and it bore no relationship with the histopathological stage.q 16. Perumal D, Pillai S, Nguyen J, Schaal C, Coppola D, Chellappan SP.

An increasing number of deep sequencing studies of MCC have identified significant differences between the number and types of point mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variants between virus-positive and virus-negative tumors. However, it has been challenging to reliably distinguish between virus positive and UV damaged MCC. Methods: In this study, we assembled a cohort of 71 MCC patients and performed deep sequencing with OncoPanel, a clinically implemented, next-generation sequencing assay targeting over 400 cancer-associated genes. To improve the accuracy and sensitivity for virus detection compared to traditional PCR and IHC methods, we developed a hybrid capture baitset against the entire MCPyV genome and software to detect integration sites and structure. Results: Sequencing from this approach revealed distinct integration junctions in the tumor genome and generated assemblies that strongly support a model of microhomology-initiated hybrid, virus-host, circular DNA intermediate that promotes focal amplification of host and viral DNA. Using the clear delineation between virus-positive and virus-negative tumors from this method, we identified recurrent somatic alterations common across MCC and alterations specific to each class of tumor, associated with differences in overall survival. Finally, comparing the molecular and clinical data from these patients revealed a surprising association of immunosuppression with virus-negative MCC and significantly shortened overall survival. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the value of high-confidence virus detection for identifying molecular mechanisms of UV and viral oncogenesis in MCC. Furthermore, integrating these data with clinical data revealed features that could impact patient outcome and improve our understanding of MCC risk factors. Keywords: Cancer genomics, Polyomavirus, Integration, Somatic variants, Mutagenesis * Correspondence: James_DeCaprio@dfci.harvard.edu 3Merkel Cell Carcinoma Center of Excellence, Dana-Farber/Brigham Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA 5Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Mayer 440, 450 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA 02215, USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the article © The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

Genome Medicine (2020) 12:30 Page 2 of 22 Background Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive neu.roendocrine carcinoma of the skin. Risk factors for devel.oping MCC include advanced age, light skin color with excessive sunlight exposure, and a variety of immunocom.promised conditions [1]. In 2008, Merkel cell polyomavi.rus (MCPyV) was first detected by Southern blot in some but not all MCC tumors with integration of viral DNA oc.curring at several different chromosomal sites. Import.antly, an identical clonal integration pattern was detected in one primary tumor and corresponding metastatic lymph node [2]. This important insight implied that inte.gration of the viral DNA was an early if not initiating event in virus-positive MCC oncogenesis. MCPyV infects most people, typically at an early age, and results in an asymptomatic and lifelong infection indicated by the per.sistent presence of antibodies to the viral coat protein VP1 [3, 4]. Although MCPyV DNA can be readily detected on the skin, the cell types where the virus replicates in vivo have not been determined [5]. Since the original discovery of MCPyV, it has become in.creasingly clear that virus-positive MCC has a different eti.ology than virus-negative, UV-associated, MCC [1]. Virus-positive MCC expresses the viral oncogenes large T anti.gen (LT) and small T antigen (ST) and the tumor genome usually contains very few mutations in cellular oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. In contrast, studies using whole exome or targeted hybrid capture sequencing have revealed that virus-negative MCC has an exceptionally high somatic mutation load predominated by UV-mediated mu.tations with frequent mutations in RB1, TP53, NOTCH1, and FAT1 [6, 7]. Wholegenomesequencing(WGS) of MCC confirmed virus-positive MCC exhibits a globally lower, non-UV-mediated, mutation burden as well as few somatic copy number amplifications, deletions, and rear.rangements compared to virus-negative MCC, while pro.viding new insights into the structure and mechanism of virus integration [8]. Accurate detection of the presence of MCPyV and dis.tinguishing between virus-positive and virus-negative MCC is important for insight into the oncogenesis, cell-of-origin, and therapeutic options. Currently, there is no routine clinical effort to distinguish between virus-positive MCC and virus-negative MCC. Several recent studies have suggested differences between virus-positive MCC and virus-negative MCC in presentation, age, and response to immunotherapy [9Ð15]. However, current techniques for determining viral status have yielded ei.ther inaccurate or ambiguous results. Although WGS provides much more genetic information on the tumor and viral genome compared to targeted approaches, it remains impractical for clinical evaluation of MCC. The most common methods for detection of MCPyV in MCC include PCR amplification of MCPyV DNA from DNA isolated from MCC tumors or immunohisto.chemistry (IHC) staining for MCPyV LT using monoclo.nal antibodies CM2B4 and Ab3 [16, 17]. However, both PCR and IHC have been shown to be unreliable in dis.tinguishing between virus-positive from virus-negative MCC. For example, a recent study of 282 cases of MCC evaluated virus positivity by IHC with monoclonal anti.bodies CM2B4 and Ab3 or by PCR with a previously val.idated primer set [18]. Notably, there was concordance for all three assays in only 167 of 282 (59.2%) cases with an additional 62 cases positive for two of the three tests. The remaining 53 (18.8%) were positive for one test or none. This study assigned the MCC to be virus-positive if two or three tests were positive, implying that detec.tion of viral DNA by PCR alone was not sufficient for a tumor to be called virus-positive MCC. Furthermore, be.cause of the sensitivity of PCR in detecting DNA, a lower limit of 0.01 copy of MCPyV DNA per tumor cell was called virus-positive MCC. Tumors containing < 0.01 viral copies/cell were called virus-negative. A differ.ent study using RNA-ISH to detect mRNA specific for MCPyV LT and ST found this method to be as sensitive as qPCR when using two primer sets and the viral copy number was set to > 0.004/cell [19]. The AMERCK test detects circulating antibodies against the MCPyV ST [20]. The sensitivity of this test is low for detection of virus-positive MCC but, when positive, can be used as a biomarker for disease status [20]. The high somatic mutation burden in virus-negative MCC is predicted to yield more tumor neoantigens than melanomas or non-small cell lung cancers (median of 173, 65, and 111 neoantigens/sample, respectively) [21][22]. As observed for other tumor types, the high neoantigen burden in virus-negative MCC corresponds to a higher degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in some tumors, but these tumors also express PD-L1 rendering these lym.phocytes ineffective [7]. Despite the numerous observed differences in mutation rate and number of predicted neoantigens, both virus-positive MCC and virus-negative MCC tumors have shown high response rates to PD-L1 and PD1 checkpoint blockade therapy [14, 15]. For further advancements to be made in understanding MCC, especially for patients not responsive to current therapies, clear and accurate determination of the MCPyV virus status and actionable variants in these tumors are re.quired. In this study, we developed a viral hybrid capture next-generation sequencing (NGS) method to detect the presence of integrated MCPyV DNA in FFPE clinical specimens for routine use in a clinical setting. This ap.proach was combined with targeted sequencing of several hundred cancer-related genes to assess oncogenic changes in the tumor genome. Lastly, we compared the sensitivity and accuracy of this viral hybrid capture approach to more traditional approaches, PCR detection of viral DNA, IHC Starrett et al. Genome Medicine (2020) 12:30 Page 3 of 22 for detection of MCPyV LT, and synoptic assessment of MCC pathology. Methods Study design and participants This study included all patients (n = 71) with a reported diagnosis of MCC at Dana-Farber/Brigham and WomenÕs Cancer Center who underwent comprehensive genomic profiling by OncoPanel between May 2013 and April 2018. OncoPanel version 3 (POPv3) is a custom hybrid capture assay targeting the exons of 447 genes and 191 re.gions across 60 genes commonly rearranged in cancer [23, 24]. A retrospective chart review collected demographic, clinical, disease, treatment, and outcome variables on all 71 patients. For 40 patients, sufficient DNA remained from the initial OncoPanel profiling or from additional FFPE tumor specimens to perform POPv3/ViroPanel. When available, FFPE sections were sectioned for immu.nohistochemistry with antibodies CM2B4 and Ab3 [17]. Sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin were evalu.ated by synoptic review [25]. Nucleic acid isolation, library preparation and sequencing To perform ViroPanel with and without supplementation with the OncoPanel (v3) bait set, purified DNA was quan.tified using a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay (Thermo Fisher). Library construction was performed using 200 ng of DNA, which was first fragmented to ~ 250 bp using a Covaris LE220 Focused ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA) followed by size-selected cleanup using Agencourt AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc. Indianapolis, IN) at a 1:1 bead to sample ratio. Fragmented DNA was converted to Illumina libraries using a KAPA HTP library kit using the manufacturerÕs recommendations (Thermo Fisher). Adapter ligation was done using xGen dual index UMI adapters (IDT, Coralville, IA). Samples were pooled in equal volume and run on an Illumina MiSeq nano flow cell to quantitate the amount of library based on the number of reads per barcode. All samples yielded sufficient library (> 250 ng) and were taken forward into hybrid capture. Libraries were pooled at equal mass (3 . 17-plex and 1 . 18-plex) to a total of 750 ng. Captures were done using the SureSelectXT Fast target enrichment assay (Agilent, Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with ViroPanel with and without supplementa.tion with the OncoPanel (v3) bait set. Captures were se.quenced on an Illumina 2500 in rapid run mode (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Sequence alignment and somatic variant calling Pooled samples were de-multiplexed and sorted using IlluminaÕs bcl2fastq software (v2.17). Reads were aligned to the reference sequence b37 edition from the Human Genome Reference Consortium as well as viral genomes targeted by the Virus Capture Baitset v2 using bwa mem (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml) [26]. The viral genomes and human genome were combined into one alignment reference so reads could map to the clos.est matching reference sequence. Duplicate reads were identified using unique molecular indices (UMIs) and marked using the Picard tools. The alignments were further refined using the Genome Ana.lysis Toolkit (GATK) for localized realignment around indel sites and base quality score recalibration [27, 28]. Mutation analysis for single nucleotide variants (SNV) was performed using MuTect v1.1.4 (CEPH control was used as the Òproject normalÓ) and annotated by Variant Effect Predictor v 79 (VEP) [29, 30]. We used the Somati.cIndelDetector tool that is part of the GATK for indel calling. After initial identification of SNVs and indels by MuTect and GATK respectively, the variants were anno.tated using OncoAnnotate to determine what genes were impacted and their effect on the amino acid sequence. OncoAnnotate also applied additional filters using the Ex.ome Sequencing Project (ESP) and gnomAD datasets to flag common SNPs. Variants that affect protein coding regions underwent further filtering/classification based on frequency in the gnomAD, ESP, and COSMIC (version 80) databases. If the frequency of the variant was less than or equal to 1% in all gnomAD and ESP populations, the variant was flagged as ÒREVIEW_REQUIREDÓ. If the frequency of the variant was greater than 1% and less than or equal to 10% in all gnomAD and ESP populations and present in ÒCOSMICÓ database at least two times, the variant was flagged as ÒRE.VIEW_REQUIREDÓ. If the frequency of the variant was between 1% and less than or equal to 10% in all gnomAD and ESP populations and not present in ÒCOSMICÓ data.base at least two times, the variant is flagged as ÒNO_RE.VIEW_GERMLINE_FILTERÓ. If the frequency of the variant was greater than 10% in any gnomAD and ESP populations, the variant was flagged as ÒNO_REVIEW_ GERMLINE_FILTERÓ. Variants with a frequency greater than 10% in any gnomAD or ESP population were consid.ered to be a common SNP irrespective of presence in the COSMIC database. Variants in the viral genomes were called using sam.tools mpileup and bcftools from the aligned bam files. Called variants were filtered to have a minimum cover.age of 5 reads and minimum allele frequency of 1% of total reads covering that base in a single sample. Vari.ants were annotated based on the NC_010277.2 refer.ence sequence in GenBank using SnpEff [31]. Recurrent copy number analysis Copy number variant calling was performed using a com.bination of VisCap Cancer and CNVkit as previously de.scribed [32, 33]. All resulting gene copy number variants Starrett et al. Genome Medicine (2020) 12:30 Page 4 of 22 from all patients were compared against each other with UV status and significant mutual exclusivity/co-occurrence was calculated using FisherÕs exact test corrected by FDR for multiple comparisons in the R statistical environment. Using the network and iGraphs packages the significantly co.occurrent variants were clustered into networks. The genes belonging to each distinct network cluster with more than five member genes were then labeled and extracted. Using these gene lists as cluster definitions, each patient was evalu.ated for presence or absence of each CNV cluster. Presence of a CNV cluster was determined if more than 50% of the member genes of that cluster were modified in the same pa.tient. Copy number variants from TCGA were retrieved from cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal.org/)and plotted using ggplot2 in the R statistical environment [34, 35]. Viral integration analysis A custom perl script was written to extract, assemble, an.notate, and visualize viral reads and determine viral inte.gration sites. Viral reads and their mates were first identified and extracted by those that have at least one mate map to the viral genome. Additional reads contain.ing viral sequence were identified by a bloom filter con.structed of unique, overlapping 31 bp k-mers of the MCPyV genome [36]. The human genome positions for any read with a mate mapping to the viral genome were output into a bed file and the orientation of viral and hu.man pairs was stored to accurately deconvolute overlap.ping integration sites. This bed file was then merged down into overlapping ranges based on orientation counting the number of reads overlapping that range. Skewdness in coverage of integration junctions was calculated by the difference in the fraction of virus-host read pairs overlap.ping the first and second halves of the aforementioned ranges. This skewdness value was used to determine the orientation of the viral-host junction (i.e., positive values, junction is on the 3. end of the range; negative values, junction is on the 5. end of the range), which was vali.dated from the results of de novo assembly. Integrated viral genomes were assembled from extracted reads using SPAdes with default parameters [37]. The assembly graphs from SPAdes were annotated using blastn against hg19 and the MCPyV reference genome with an e-value cutoff of 1.10. 10. Annotated assembly graphs were visualized using the ggraph R package. Integrations sites confirmed by reference guided align.ment and assembly data were analyzed for stretches of microhomology between the human and viral genomes by selecting 10 bp upstream and downstream of the integra.tion junction on the viral and human genomes. Within these sequences stretches of identical sequence at the same position longer than two base pairs were counted. Overall homology between the sequences was calculated by Levenshtein distance. Three integration junctions with indeterminate DNA sequence ranging from 1 to 25 bp inserted between viral and human DNA were excluded from analysis. Expected microhomology was calculated by randomly selecting 1000 20 bp pairs of non-N containing sequence from the human and MCPyV genomes. Integration site proximity to repeat elements were de.termined using bedtools closest and repeatmasker anno.tations acquired from the UCSC genome browser [38]. Expected frequency of integration near repeat elements was determined by randomly selecting 1000 sites in the human genome. Sites within 2 kb of a repeat element were counted as close proximity. Functional annotation of somatic mutations and viral integration events was performed using PANTHER (www.pantherdb.org)[39]. Statistics The association between relapse and genomic character.istics are tested with FisherÕs exact test using all patient sequencing data regardless of primary or recurrence bi.opsy. Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from initial diagnosis to death, and patients who did not die are censored at the last follow-up date. The 95% confi.dence intervals of the median OS times are estimated using log(.log(OS)) methodology. Statistical significance is defined as p ² 0.05. Associations between recurrent CNV, TMB, or viral copies and overall survival were calculated and graphed using GraphPad Prism 7. FisherÕs exact test and Kaplan-Meier curves were computed with the R statistical envir.onment. Significant enrichment of microhomology and re.peat elements at integrations sites was determined using FisherÕs exact test between observed and expected events. Human subjects This study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles and approved by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute institutional review board. Written in.formed consent was received from participants prior to inclusion in the study. Results Summary of patient cohort A total of 71 patients diagnosed with MCC were in.cluded in this study (Table 1). The median (95% CI) follow-up duration from initial diagnosis of MCC was 47 (95% CI: 38Ð60) months based on inverse Kaplan-Meier estimation. Overall, 69 enrolled patients were white and two were black. Forty (56%) patients were male. The me.dian age was 70 years (range < 50 to 93). The initial site of MCC presentation was in the head and neck (27%), upper extremity (20%), lower extremity (21%), and trunk (32%). The seventh edition TNM staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) was used Starrett et al.

Gen.omic studies were performed using DNA isolated from tu.mors obtained at the time of initial diagnosis (n=50) or upon relapse (n=21). The total number of mutations ranged from 0 to 73 corresponding to a tumor mutational burden (TMB; mutations/megabase) from 0 to 38.89 with four cases containing no detectable mutations (Fig. 1a, Additional file 1: Table S1). From this mutation data, pa.tients were binned into TMB-high (³ 20), TMB-intermediate (> 6 < 20), and TMB-low (² 6). A limited set of mutation signatures could be identified (see ÒMethodsÓ). The UV mutational signature (Signature 7) was detected in 24 cases, corresponding to the TMB-high patients [40]. Additional mutational signatures identified included Aging (Signature 1; 3 cases), APOBEC (Signatures 2 and 13; 4 cases with 3 that also had an UV signature), and Signature 5 (one case) (Fig. 1a, Additional file 1: Table S1). TMB had some correlation with the number of copy number altered genes (Fig. 1b). Several genes including RB1, TP53, KMT2D, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and FAT1 were highly enriched for missense and truncating mutations (Fig. 1c, Additional file 2: Fig. S1). Single and dinucleotide substitutions in RB1 and TP53 revealed that most were likely mediated by UV dam.age (CC > TT, C > T; Fig. 1d). Copy number variants (CNVs) were examined indi.vidually as well as against each other and other likely functional somatic changes for significant co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity (Additional file 1: Table S2). Clus.ters of significantly co-occurrent CNVs were determined via network analysis (Fig. 2a, Additional file 2: Fig. S2 & Fig. S3). From these analyses, two distinct CNV clusters were each found to be altered in more than 36% of cases (Fig. 2b, c). Chromosome 10 (cluster 14) had frequent copy number loss with 26 tumors showing heterozygous or homozygous loss of the chromosome (Fig. 2b) [41]. Some cancer-relevant genes on chromosome 10 include PTEN and SUFU, negative regulators of PI3K and Hedgehog signaling respectively, with deletions reported in prior studies of MCC [41, 42]. A region of Chr1q (cluster 13) was amplified in 28 cases. This region in.cludes MDM4 (also known as MDMX), whose protein product cooperates with MDM2 to promote the ubiqui.tination and subsequent degradation of p53 (Fig. 2b) [43, 44]. In addition, we observed a focal amplification of MYCL within a greater amplification of Chr1p (cluster 4), which was reported in an earlier study of MCC [45]. CNV clusters 13 and 14 were observed at nearly equal frequencies in both TMB-high and TMB-low cases (Fig. 2b, c). Six other CNV clusters were strongly associ.ated with UV signature and high TMB (Fig. 2c). Func.tional annotation of the clusters revealed that the two largest UV-associated CNV clusters (1 and 3) had signifi.cant enrichment for genes related broadly to DNA dam.age response and S-phase DNA damage checkpoint likely enhancing tolerance for UV mutagenesis. Cluster 5, corresponding to 6p22.3 to 6q26 and likely representing a gain of the entire chromosome 6, was the only cluster more than twice as frequent in TMB-low tu.mors than TMB-high tumors (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, 33.3% (6/18) of metastatic tumors carried cluster 5 and all but one of these metastatic tumors were TMB-low MCC. Fur.thermore, CNV cluster 5 was 2.5 times more frequent in TMB-low (25%, 11/44) than TMB-high (11%, 2/18) tumors in primary tumors. Both TMB-low and TMB-high patients with amplification of CNV cluster 5 had significantly im.proved overall survival compared to wild type carrying pa.tients (p = 0.005). Restrictingthisanalysistoonlyprimary tumors, revealed that there were no deaths at the time of this study in patients carrying this amplification (p =0.007) Starrett et al.

Unsurprisingly, considering the prevalence of this CNV event in metastatic patients, there was no difference in recurrence-free survival (RFS, Additional file 2: Fig. S4). The recurrent copy number events on chromosomes 1, 6, and 10 were compared within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for similarities to other tumor types (Fig. 2fÐh). This analysis revealed that the chromosome 1 (cluster 13) amplification was also frequently observed in ovarian, breast, and bladder cancers, whereas the chromosome 10 (cluster 14) loss was most frequently seen in prostate cancer. Gain of chromosome 6 (cluster 5) was most frequently seen in ovarian, bladder, and esophago-gastric cancers. Analysis of viral sequences in tumors Of the 71 tumors analyzed by OncoPanel, 48 with suffi.cient remaining material were re-analyzed by OncoPanel (Profile/OncoPanel version 3, POPv3) combined with a hybrid-capture probe bait set targeting the entire gen.ome of MCPyV and other known oncogenic viruses (ViroPanel). For the 48 cases, the number of MCPyV reads ranged from 0 to 21,095,751 with only a single case having zero MCPyV reads (Fig. 3a). In total, 28 cases had substantial reads (> 6800) mapping to the MCPyV genome that also supported integration of the virus into the host genome through reads and read pairs that span integration junctions. For the remaining 20 cases without evidence of integration, the number of viral reads ranged from 0 to 971. Generally, these cases had reads that covered less than 10% of the viral genome with the normalized coverage less than two logs com.pared to samples with evidence for virus integration (Fig. 3b, c). Concordantly, the viral reads from most of these cases were unable to be assembled into larger viral contigs. Two cases, MCC011 and MCC015, had 212 and 177 MCPyV reads that could be assembled into nine and five contigs each smaller than 761 base pairs, Starrett et al.

Case MCC007 had the most reads of any likely virus-negative sample and could be assembled into a single 5343 bp contig. However, analysis of the point and deletion variants in these aforementioned viral con.tigs revealed that they were identical to the virus se.quence from patient MCC037 indicating that the viral reads resulted from low-level contamination (< 0.005% of MCC037 MCPyV reads were detected in other samples). For the 28 cases with evidence for integration of the viral DNA into the tumor, the number of reads mapping to the viral genome ranged from 6824 to 21,095,751 (me.dian 28,726). Consistent with previous reports, the inte.grated viral genome had undergone extensive mutagenesis Starrett et al.

In 10 cases, approximately half of the total viral genome was deleted, 6 cases had approximately 25% of the viral genome deleted, while 12 cases had sequences corresponding to the entire or nearly complete genome (Figs. 3c and 4). In all but one of the cases with a nearly complete coverage of the viral genome, there was a clonal point mutation which inserted a premature stop codon in LT resulting in truncated proteins between 208 and 771 amino acids (Fig. 5a) similar to what has previously been seen in MCC cell lines and clinical cohorts. In a single case (MCC054), LT was truncated by a 5-bp deletion resulting in a frame shift that introduced a premature stop codon in frame. In all cases, the non-coding control re.gion, the N-terminal 208 residues of LT, and an intact ST region of the viral genome were conserved. Beyond indels and nonsense mutations, LT also car.ried numerous novel clonal missense mutations (Fig. 5a) unique to the patients in this cohort. In stark contrast, ST only had missense mutations at three residues, and the amino acid change A20S is consistent with a previ.ously observed MCPyV strain difference (GenBank identical protein accession number: ACI25295.1). The other missense mutations occurred clonally at H41Y and N100S once in the entire cohort (Fig. 5b). Neither of these mutations are present in any of the ST sequences in GenBank and have not been previously reported. The integration sites were mapped using the oncovirus tools suite (https://github.com/gstarrett/oncovirus_tools) (Fig. 6a, Table 2)[46]. As previously reported, integrations primarily fell into two categories: either those that appear as a single integration event or as two events separated by > 10 kilobases (kb) [8]. Interestingly, two cases had inte.gration events in non-identical but overlapping sites in chromosome 1 (Fig. 6b). These represent the first reported cases of recurrent viral integration sites in MCC. Based on previous MCC WGS, MCPyV integration sites frequently coincide with focal amplifications in the human genome. We can therefore infer that the regions between distant (> 10 kb) viral integration sites were amplified; however, no targeted exon were within these regions [8]. Because of the limited number of capture targets sequence by the OncoPanel platform, determin.ing the exact boundaries of the expected virus-mediated amplifications in cases with junctions < 10 kb apart was Starrett et al.

Scales for the coverage plots are set from 0 to the maximum read coverage per patient.

The effects of point mutations within LT antigen are indicated by a triangle (frameshift) or asterisk (stop gain) at the top of the vertical line of the mutation not possible. However, using the normalized viral cover.age, the estimated number of viral genome copies ranged between 1 and 1881 copies (median: 7, interquartile range (IQR) 4Ð13) (Table 2). When annotating these re.gions, we observed that they frequently contain enhancer regions that may contribute to oncogenesis as seen in HPV-associated tumors [47]. Uniquely, patient MCC026 had integrations in chromosomes 9, 16, and 18, all of which had integration sites separated by between 107.5 and 129.9 kbp appearing to be distinct events. Using automated computational methods, we could not confidently determine an integration site for case MCC037 with thehighest viralgenomecopynumberinthisstudy. Manually interrogating the human sequence hits from the assembly revealed that it matched a tandem repeat se.quence flanked by MLT1H2 ERVL-MaLR elements. Based on the estimated copy number and the assembly graph, the viral component of this fusion DNA structure is likely larger than 10 Mbp (Additional file 3:Fig. S6). With the high depth of coverage facilitated by the targeted NGS method, high-resolution assemblies for the integrated virus were generated. Many integrations that appeared as a single linear contig contained a single copy of the viral genome flanked by the host genome (Fig. 6c, Additional file 3: Fig. S6). However, other integrations generated more complex assembly graphs with a multiple contigs linked together in a ÒpigtailsÓ conformation (Fig. 6d, Additional file 3: Fig. S6). Based on coverage and conformation, this graph likely represents an integration event containing partially duplicated viral genome conca.temers fused to different segments of the human genome. For samples with distant integration sites, the directional.ity of the virus-host junctions strongly supports a circular virus-host DNA fusion intermediate prior to reintegration into the host chromosome. This model is further sup.ported by assemblies in which one arm of the fusion con.tains sequences from both distant sites of the human genome (Fig. 6e, Additional file 3:Fig.S6). To address a possible mechanism for integration, we looked for microhomology between the human and MCPyV genomes at fusion junctions. We found signifi.cant enrichment for 4, 5, and 7 bp sequence microho.mology at the site of integration compared to randomly selected sites in the human and MCPyV genomes Starrett et al.

There was no significant increase in overall homology between MCPyV and human DNA at integra.tion sites versus randomly selected sites. Patient MCC027 had the integration site with the longest stretch of homology, and MCC041 had both the integra.tion site with the greatest overall homology on its 3. end and lowest homology with no microhomology greater than 1bp on its 5. end (Fig. 6g). Additionally, we anno.tated integration sites for proximity to repeat elements, including LINEs, SINEs, LTR retrotransposons, and sim.ple repeats in the human genome. No type of repeat element was significantly enriched, but all integration sites were within 1.5 kb of a repeat element and there was a trend towards integrations near LTR retrotranspo.sons and low-complexity regions (Fig. 6h). Distinguishing virus-positive MCC from virus-negative MCC using somatic variants in comparison to immunohistochemistry and PCR Given the striking differences in the number of muta.tions and mutational signature we observed in the Viro-Panel dataset that strongly correlated with virus integration, we compared the data from the OncoPanel and POPv3/ViroPanel datasets to determine the viral status of all 71 tumors studied (Table 3). From the OncoPanel sequencing, we identified off-target reads for MCPyV in a total of 18/71 cases, ranging from 1 to 194 reads total. When compared to the ViroPanel data, there was a rough correlation between the number of off-target reads and the number of MCPyV reads in the Vir.oPanel dataset. There were 8 samples with MCPyV reads in the OncoPanel dataset that were not also analyzed by ViroPanel. None of these 8 cases have any evidence for a UV mutational signature. We assessed the total number of mutations, TMB, UV signature, and detection of MCPyV reads to characterize each tumor as either virus-positive MCC or virus-negative MCC. Using these criteria, we called 25 tumors as virus-negative. All but one of the virus-negative MCC tumors had a UV mutational signature and had higher number of total mutations (18Ð73), higher TMB, and absence of inte.grated MCPyV compared to virus-positive MCC. The virus-negative MCC without a UV signature (MCC007) originally presented as a subcutaneous breast mass [48]. A total of 46 MCC tumors of the 71 analyzed were character.ized as virus-positive. These virus-positive MCC had an ab.sence of UV mutational signature, a lower number of total mutations (0Ð16), and lower TMB than did any of the virus-negative MCC. The TMB-low and -high categories had perfect concordance with virus-positive and virus-negative MCC determined by sequencing, respectively. The TMB-intermediate samples were mostly virus-negative (7/9), but the lowest two TMB patients in this cat.egory are likely virus-positive based on ViroPanel sequen.cing and absence of UV mutation signature. FFPE sections were available for 28 of the 71 cases to assess for MCPyV LT by IHC with antibodies CM2B4 and Ab3. For 8 of the virus-negative MCC, all were negative by IHC with both antibodies. For 20 virus-positive MCC cases, we observed 16 stained positive with both antibodies and 4 were negative (Table 3). In addition, DNA was tested by PCR with 5 primer sets for 15 cases. In 9 virus-positive MCC cases, all returned positive results with 2 to 5 primer sets (Table 3). For 6 virus-negative cases, PCR was negative for 5 primer sets and one was positive with one primer set. Interestingly, the virus-negative MCC (MCC007) with one PCR pri.mer set positive also ranked at the TMB borderline Starrett et al.

Criteria evaluated included procedure, site, size (mm), thickness (mm), lymphovascular invasion, tumor extension, mi.totic rate, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), growth pattern, neurotropism, and necrosis (%). TILS were largely absent in both virus-positive and virus-negative samples. An infiltrative growth pattern was observed in virus-positive MCC and nodular or nodular infiltrative observed in both forms of MCC. Neurotropism was present in three cases of virus-positive MCC and necro.sis which ranged from 0 to 40%. Statistical comparison of clinical and molecular characteristics Overall, 28 patients remained disease free after initial therapy and 43 developed one or more relapses or per.sisted as stage IV (Additional file 2: Fig. S5). According to the biopsy type and first relapse status, patients could be grouped into primary biopsy with no further recur.rence (N = 30), primary biopsy with further recurrence (N = 22), and recurrence biopsy (N = 19). For all biopsies annotated as a recurrence, the first recurrence occurred before the biopsy was obtained. Among the 19 recur.rence biopsies, 15 were distant metastatic biopsies, one local recurrence (MCC027), one unspecified recurrence (MCC063), one second recurrence (MCC057), and one local recurrence with no prior chemo/XRT (MCC026). Regardless of the biopsy type, all patients and sequen.cing data were grouped into either no relapse (N = 30) or relapse (N = 41). Table 4 shows the association be.tween relapse and genomic characteristics. Among 71 patients, 30 (42.3%) patients had no relapse and 41 (57.7%) had relapse after initial diagnosis. From FisherÕs exact test results, UV, RB1 status, TP53 status, and virus status were all not significantly associated with relapse (Table 4). If the OncoPanel data obtained after relapse (and prior treatment) was excluded and restricted to the 52 patients with primary biopsy, UV, RB1 status, TP53 status, and virus status were all not significantly associ.ated with relapse (Additional file 1: Table S5). Consistent with known risk factors of MCC, 10 of the 71 cases had immunosuppression diagnosed prior to develop.ing MCC. Remarkably, 8 of the 10 (80%) of the immuno.suppressed cases were identified as virus-negative MCC with relatively high TMB compared to the 28% virus-negative MCC in immunocompetent patients (Fig. 7a, Table 5). Virus-negative MCC was present in three pa.tients with solid organ transplantation; three with auto.immune diseases including myasthenia gravis, rheumatoid arthritis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis; one with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS); and another with WaldenstromÕs macroglobuli.nemia. In contrast, virus-positive MCC was identified in a patient with mantle zone lymphoma having been treated with Rituximab for 3 years and another with germline mu.tations in NF1 and GATA2 [49]. The median OS for pa.tients with immunosuppression was 17.5 months (95% CI 5.6Ð24.4 months), significantly shorter than patients with.out immunosuppression (48.5 months, 95% CI 35.4Ð113.3 months, p < 0.01) (Fig. 7b, Table 5). Immunosuppressed patients also exhibited significantly shorter recurrence-free survival, 7.5 months (95% CI 3.5Ð20.1 months) and 20.2 months (95% CI 12.9Ð50.2 months, p = 0.01), respectively. We acknowledge that some cases have relatively short follow-up times that may impact survival analysis; how.ever, the association of OS and immunosuppression only shifts slightly after keeping patients with follow-up times greater than 6 months (n = 63) remaining statistically sig.nificant. Under this criterion, the median OS for immuno.competent and immunosuppressed cases were 48.5 months (95% CI 35.4 to 113.3 months) and 21.6 months (95% CI 6.9 to 30.7 months, p value < 0.01), respectively. Discussion We undertook this study to develop an assay to more accurately distinguish between virus-positive and virus-negative MCC by genetic features.

The viral hybrid capture assay, ViroPanel, ac.quired a high number of MCPyV reads for many sam.ples. Importantly, evidence for specific integration was associated with all cases with a high number of reads (> 6000). Spurious MCPyV reads were also detected in 19 of 20 MCC cases that were deemed to be virus-negative by TMB and UV mutations. There was no evidence for integration in these cases; rather, these reads could be traced to be extremely low-level contamination from MCC037 during library preparation or sequencing. In contrast, true virus-positive MCCs have low TMB with clear assemblies of virus-host junctions with MCC-hallmark deletions in the MCPyV genome. Integration sites were observed in 12 different chro.mosomes with the most occurring on chromosome 5. In addition, two fully overlapping integration sites from two different tumors were observed on chromosome 1 separated by only 10Ð20 kb. Based on the clonality of de.letions and point mutations in the MCPyV genome, these events most likely occurred before or during inte.gration as was similarly determined from another study on MCC cell lines [50]. For both MCPyV and HPV, it has previously been proposed that integration initiates after DNA double strand breaks in the host genome and viral genomes, likely during viral genome replication as integrated viral concatemers are common [8, 51]. In this study, we identified that integration is then likely medi.ated through erroneous DNA repair at sites of microho.mology between the host and viral genomes. This is Starrett et al.

For both MCPyV and HPV mediated tumors, the MMEJ event frequently leads to the formation of a transiently circular DNA intermediate, which can be amplified through aberrant firing of the viral origin of replication [53]. The resulting large linear DNA then reintegrates into the chromosome and appears as amplified regions of the host genome in a tandem head-to-tail conformation interspersed with the viral genome [8]. Case MCC026 has three apparently separate integration events occurring on different chromosomes. The integra.tion event on chromosome 16 only contains a small sec.tion of the viral genome from positions 2853Ð3521, which would only encode the helicase domain of LT and there.fore is unlikely to contribute to tumor survival. Conversely, the event on chromosome 18 has a full copy of the viral genome while the event on chromosome 9 contains the NCCR, ST, and a truncated LT, likely sufficient to contrib.ute to oncogenesis. Based on the assembly graphs and coverage, one or both of these integration events have more than one copy of ST and LT (Fig. 4 and Add.itional file 3: Fig. S6). Distinct sequences derived during as.sembly and the distances between the intrachromosomal junctions (107Ð129kbp) indicate that these likely are separ.ate events, but only long-read sequencing of this tumor can definitively determine that these are not part of a larger interchromosomal translocation. The most common chromosomal copy number changes involved chromosomes 1 and 10. Amplification of 1p (clus.ter 4) involving MYCL was observed more commonly in virus-negative cases, but was identified in a few virus-positive cases. Interestingly, in virus-positive MCC, MCPyV ST binds MYCL and the EP400 chromatin modifying Starrett et al.

Amplification of MYCL is likely to be an onco.genic event that contributes to MCC aggressiveness. Amp.lification of Chr1q (cluster 13) was also observed in both virus-positive and virus-negative MCC. This region in.cludes MDM4, whose protein product cooperates with MDM2 to promote the ubiquitination and subsequent deg.radation of p53 [43, 44]. There may be additional pro.oncogenic genes in this cluster that contribute to MCC oncogenesis when p53 is mutated. Heterozygous loss of chromosome 10 (cluster 14) was observed in 26/71 MCC including both virus-positive and virus-negative tumors. Loss of chromosome 10 likely reduces PTEN levels con.tributing to activation of the PI3K signaling pathway. A recurrent amplification of chromosome 6 has previ.ously been observed for MCC; however, this observation predated the discovery of MCPyV and was not associated with morphology or outcome [55]. In other cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer, this amplifica.tion is typically associated with worse outcome [55]. Al.though the chromosome 6 amplification in this study was significantly associated with better overall survival, it was also more frequent in metastasis. This amplification con.tains genes such as VEGFA, which promotes angiogenesis and has been observed to be expressed at higher levels in distant ovarian cancer metastases [56]. Interestingly, further analysis of genes that are more abundantly mutated in the sequenced metastatic lesions, revealed statistically signifi.cant (q =2.47. 10. 7) pathway enrichment for angiogenesis as well as EGFR signaling and p53 dysregulation. FANCE is also carried on this chromosome and as a DNA damage re.sponse gene act to limit number of point mutations and copy number changes observed in virus-positive MCC, hin.dering tumor evolution. Together, this amplification co-occurring with MCPyV may represent a less fatal, but more metastatic subtype of MCC. Additionally, this result could be impacted by diagnosis, treatment, or study recruitment of metastatic MCC. Unexpectedly, we observed that 8 of 10 cases with im.munosuppression were virus-negative MCC. While it was recognized in the early 1990s that individuals with hematologic malignancies that developed MCC had a poor prognosis [57], it was not until 1997 when a direct link between immunosuppression and MCC was postu.lated [58]. At that time, a correlation was noted between medically induced immunosuppression with azathio.prine and cyclosporine and the development and rapid spread of MCC. Early reports highlighted a prolonged period of immunosuppression prior to MCC develop.ment. Notably, the search for a viral pathogen in MCC was initiated because of reports linking MCC with im.munosuppression and with HIV-1/AIDS [2]. A subse.quent report has shown similar rates of MCPyV.positivity in immunocompetent and suppressed patients, but relied on PCR and IHC for virus detection [18]. In the present report, three solid organ transplant recip.ients, three with chronic autoimmune diseases, and two with hematologic malignancies developed virus-negative Starrett et al.

It is well established that the risk for developing MCC is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or medically in.duced immunosuppression for solid organ transplantation [58Ð61]. Within the latter population, skin cancers ac.count for 40Ð50% of all posttransplant malignancies with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) comprising 90Ð95% of these skin cancers [62]. Importantly, some therapeutics used in organ transplant.ation are known to further increase risk for developing skin cancers. Azathioprine can sensitize cells to UV-induced damage through the incorporation of a metabol.ite into DNA that generates reactive oxygen species upon exposure to UV light [63]. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate and anti-TNF drugs were associ.ated with an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer Starrett et al.

The increased risk for skin cancers in organ trans.plant recipients and rheumatoid arthritis is associated with UV-light-induced mutagenesis for SCC and BCC. There.fore, the increased risk for UV-induced skin cancers may also extend to virus-negative MCC. Although this study is one of the largest molecular studies on MCC genetics to date, the small sample size and inherent confounding fac.tors of studying outcome in a cancer that manifests in older populations are important limitations. This also highlights the need for accurate determination of virus sta.tus and importance to continue to study this rare cancer to fully address the involvement of immune suppression on the etiology and outcome of this aggressive cancer. Despite the significant differences in the TMB between virus-positive and virus-negative MCC, there were few phenotypic differences in the two types of MCC. Based on histopathological features alone, two subtypes of MCC can be recognized: pure neuroendocrine tumors Starrett et al. Genome Medicine (2020) 12:30 Page 20 of 22 and combined tumors with neuroendocrine and diver.gent (mainly squamous) differentiation. Most pure tu.mors are MCPyV-positive and CK20-positive while combined tumors are uniformly MCPyV-negative and occasionally CK-20 negative [9, 65]. Virus-negative MCC can also present as pure neuroendocrine-type MCC. While genomic sequencing has revealed that virus-negative MCC has evidence for a high degree of UV damage, this does not exclude a role for UV exposure in the development of virus-positive MCC. The relative lack of UV damaged DNA in virus-positive MCC indi.cates that the etiologies are clearly different, suggesting that the precursor to virus-negative MCC was a recipient of lifelong intense UV exposure while the virus-positive MCC were not exposed to sunlight for the same degree or for as long. It was reported that the early promoter of MCPyV responds to UV exposure and that levels of ST mRNA increased in UV exposed skin from a healthy hu.man volunteer [66]. Transient UV exposure could affect the immune response to virus-negative and virus-positive MCC etiology. The effect of UV radiation in the pathogenesis of MCC has been suggested to be more likely a result of immune modulation rather than direct effects on DNA itself [67]. Conclusions Here we present a comprehensive characterization of the Merkel cell carcinoma genetics using a clinically im.plemented sequencing platform. This platform was aug.mented using a hybrid capture baitset against Merkel cell polyomavirus. From our analyses, we identified CNV clusters unique to and common to virus-negative and virus-positive, which reflect the evolutionary mecha.nisms of the tumors. We also accurately reconstructed the viral integration events providing clear evidence for a circular host-fusion DNA intermediate initiated by re.combination at 4+ bp microhomology enriched at low-complexity regions in the human genome. Lastly, we ob.served a surprising number of virus-negative tumors in immunosuppressed patients in our cohort potentially reflecting a previously misunderstood risk population. Supplementary information Supplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10. 1186/s13073-020-00727-4. Additional file 1: Table S1.
