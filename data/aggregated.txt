The distribution features and anatomic mapping of ALMs ","may facilitate the early clinical diagnosis of ALM. ","","Introduction ","","Malignant melanoma is among the most serious types of skin ma-","lignancy. Although cutaneous melanoma accounts for only approxi-","mately 1 % of all skin cancers, it is associated with the highest mortality ","rate across all skin cancers. Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is the ","most common melanoma subtype diagnosed in Asia, contributing to ","over 50 % of all melanoma cases.1–5 Common risk factors for non-ALM ","cutaneous melanoma include sun exposure, ultraviolet radiation, per-","sonal or family history of melanoma, fair skin, and preexisting atypical ","melanocytic nevi. By contrast, stress-bearing activities, penetrative in-","juries, heavy exposure to agricultural chemicals, and ethnicity have ","been reported as risk factors for ALM. The clinical manifestations of ALM ","include an asymmetrical, tan-to-brown appearance with an irregular ","border that grows in size over time. Anatomically, ALMs most ","commonly develop on the palms, soles, terminal phalanges, and sub-","ungual areas.6 The foot is the most common location, with an incidence ","","5‒16-fold higher than for any other anatomical location.6,7 Clinically, ","melanoma is very aggressive, characterized by early metastasis, and ","advanced melanoma is associated with poor prognosis, highlighting the ","importance of early detection and diagnosis. ","","Several benign pigmented lesions, such as acral melanocytic nevi ","(AMNs), blue nevi, and lentigines, also develop due to melanocytic ","proliferation and can present with a similar appearance and growth ","pattern to melanoma, which can make the clinical differential diagnosis ","between benign and malignant lesions difficult. Common diagnostic ","tools include dermoscopic examination and excisional biopsy. The novel ","concept that ALMs may exhibit a distinct anatomic distribution pattern ","was recently suggested.8 Several studies indicated that ALMs over the ","soles tended to develop in stress-bearing areas, such as the forefoot and ","heel, among Taiwanese, Japanese, and Caucasian populations.8–10 By ","contrast, AMNs over the soles tend to develop in non–stress-bearing ","areas, such as the arch, among Korean patients.11 A distinct anatomic ","pattern has also been reported for palmar ALMs, which tend to occur in ","","","*Corresponding author.

","","","Based on these studies, the unique anatomic distribution pattern may ","represent a useful feature of ALMs, facilitating early detection and differentiation ","from benign lesions. We established a clinical database of ","ALMs and AMNs identified on the palms and soles of Taiwanese patients ","and evaluated the correlation between mechanical stress and anatomic ","distribution, comparing ALMs and AMNs.

The data for 1400 patients who were clinically ","diagnosed with AMNs and ALMs between January 1, 2000, and January ","31, 2022, at the National Taiwan University Hospital were obtained ","using a computer-assisted search. All cases were evaluated by at least ","two pathology faculty members at the time of diagnosis. Cases were ","included in the current analysis if they met the following inclusion ","criteria: 1) biopsy-confirmed AMNs or ALMs, 2) location on the plantar ","or palmar regions, and 3) the presence of clinical photographs with a ","clear presentation of size and localization. Clinicopathological data ","regarding patient demographics, pathohistological reports, and Breslow ","thickness for ALMs were collected. Patients without complete information ","(n = ","450) and appropriate photography (n = ","464) were excluded ","from the analysis. AMN subtypes included junctional nevi, compound ","nevi, intradermal nevi, dysplastic nevi, lentigo, and blue nevi. AMN ","lesions were divided into subgroups of atypical or non-atypical AMN. ","Lesions with documented nuclear atypia, architectural atypia, or cytological ","atypia based on pathological reports were classified as atypical ","nevi. ","","Anatomic mapping of AMNs and ALMs ","","In each clinical image of a plantar lesion, the width of the foot was ","","2","","digitally magnified to 26 cm.

The ","rear, midfoot, and the front of the foot were categorized as stress-bearing ","areas.8,9 In each clinical image of a palmar lesion, the width of the palm ","was digitally magnified to 8 cm. Pixels of 0.25 cm2 were used to plot all ","palmar lesions. The palms were subdivided into six areas based on ","previous studies: thenar area, hypothenar area, metacarpal area, central ","triangular area, opposition area, and fingers.12–14 The distal portion of ","the transverse crease, including the metacarpal region and the fingers ","were categorized as the stress-bearing areas, as those areas are subject to ","the most mechanical stress with grip.9,12,13,15 ","","Statistical analysis ","","Descriptive statistics and a chart review were used to summarize the ","clinicopathological data associated with ALMs and AMNs.

","","16 cases).13 A similar phenomenon was observed in our study, as subungual ","melanoma comprised 40 % of palmar ALM cases. The mechanism ","underlying subungual melanoma involves the pigmentation of the nail ","bed, and patients who suffer several direct traumatic injuries over the ","nails may be predisposed to the development of subungual melanoma.","18–20 Due to the high incidence of subungual melanomas reported ","in these studies, the presence of subungual pigmented lesions ","combined with a history of repeated traumatic injuries to the nail beds ","should be considered warning signs for the potential evolution of subungual ","melanoma. ","","It is suggested that many melanomas, including acral and mucosal ","melanomas, arise de novo, not from melanocytic nevus.23 The distribution ","pattern for ALMs was significantly different from those for all ","AMNs and non-atypical AMNs in our study, a finding similar to the results ","reported by previous studies.17 Furthermore, there was no significant ","difference observed in the distribution patterns between atypical ","AMNs and ALMs. This suggests that atypical AMNs and ALMs may share ","a similar distribution pattern. However, it is essential to obtain more ","clinical data due to the limited number of cases in our study. The lack of ","significance in our results may be attributed to the reduced statistical ","power resulting from the subdivision of the sample size into subgroups. ","It’s crucial to emphasize that further clinical data are required to validate ","this finding, given the study’s limited case inclusion. ","","A distinct pathogenic mechanism has been suggested for ALM relative ","to other cutaneous melanoma due to differences in mutations and ","distributions.24–28 The dysregulation of the MAPK pathway due to BRAF ","and NRAS mutation has been identified in 80 % of sporadic melanoma ","cases.24–27 However, ALM has relatively higher frequencies of NRAS, ","NF1, and KIT mutations and a lower frequency of BRAF mutations.","24,25,28 A recent study sequenced the ALM genome and found the ","specific enrichment of CRKL amplifications; an in vivo model was also ","established, which revealed that acral melanocytes were more susceptible ","to CRKL transformation than melanocytes located at other ","anatomic sites.25 This finding suggests that the oncogenes responsible ","for melanoma development may present with positional dependence. In ","addition, mechanical stress and chronic trauma have been hypothesized ","to play important roles in the development of ALM.8–13 The long-term ","burdens of weight-bearing and shear stress that stress-bearing areas ","","\f","S.-N. Chen et al. ","","are subjected to may result in more frequent skin breakdown.8,9,29 A ","recent article reported that weight-bearing activities could cause impairments ","to the nuclear membrane and disrupt genome integrity in ","plantar melanoma, promoting mutagenesis.30 This may also explain the ","insignificant results of distributions among palmar ALMs and AMNs ","considering the palms are not under similar stress as the soles. The ","scarcity of point mutations in acral melanoma is in stark contrast to the ","notable abundance of copy number and structural aberrations.31 Specifically, ","this includes the occurrence of multiple amplifications, deletions, ","and intra-and inter-chromosomal rearrangements.32–34 It is ","speculated that the complex genetic aberrations affecting normal melanocytes, ","serve as the initiating events of acral melanoma. These aberrations ","may include double-stranded DNA break, possibly induced by ","physical force, and are considered a significant mutational mechanism ","in the activation of oncogenes.23,30 Future studies may focus on the ","molecular mechanisms underlying location-specific and stress-induced ","oncogenesis to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying ALM. ","","A strength of our research was the anatomic mapping and analysis of ","ALM and AMN distributions among the Taiwanese population, which ","may facilitate the differentiation of pigmented lesions. The earlier ","detection and diagnosis of malignant lesions allows for timely treatment ","and the avoidance of metastasis. However, our study also has several ","limitations. First, due to the retrospective nature of the study, important ","clinical information was not collected, such as occupation, trauma history, ","and irritant exposure history. Second, the numbers of palmar ALMs ","and atypical AMNs cases were insufficient, and more data are needed. ","Third, the sole was divided into 5 subunits and the palm was divided into ","6 subunits in our study, but the exact pressure applied to each lesion site ","was not collected by pedobarography or sensor gloves.30 Future work ","involving a larger database and more precise measurements to assess ","stress remains necessary. ","","Conclusion ","","Summarizing our results, stress-bearing areas are more common locations ","for the development of plantar ALM, whereas plantar AMN, ","palmar ALM and AMN showed no preferences for either stress-bearing or ","non–stress-bearing areas. Significant differences were observed in the ","distributions of plantar ALM and AMN and no significant differences ","were observed between the distributions of palmar ALM and AMN. The ","anatomic locations of melanoma are associated with distinct molecular ","and clinical subtypes. Even within the skin, melanocytes residing in ","different anatomic sites can have different susceptibilities to ","transformation. ","","Conflicts of interest ","","None.

Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are included ","in the spectrum of CTCL. This spectrum also includes alopecia mucinosis, ","pagetoid reticulosis or Woringer-Kolopp disease, granulomatous slack skin, ","hypopigmented mycosis fungoides, and papuloerythrodermic mycosis fungoides. ","The diagnosis of CTCL is based on clinical and pathological findings ","and has been improved by immunophenotyping and molecular techniques, ","including assessment of T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. Once a diagnosis ","of CTCL has been confirmed, assessment of the extent of cutaneous and extra-","cutaneous involvement is essential for staging. A number of staging classifications ","have been used to determine prognosis and optimal therapy. Although ","extensive information has been published on the biology and pathophysiology of ","CTCL, including recent evidence about mutations in tumor suppressor genes, ","initial management has not changed dramatically over the last several decades. ","This is due, in part, to the excellent prognosis when cutaneous involvement is ","limited. Topical nitrogen mustard, psoralen plus UV-A, and total skin electron ","beam radiation are the mainstay of treatment for T1 or stage I disease, with 5year ","survival rates over 90%. More innovative treatments have been examined ","for cutaneous tumors or generalized erythroderma (T3 or T4 disease) because ","long-term survival is below 40% with traditional therapies. In this issue of ","Current Problems in Dermatology, Drs Kim-James and Heffernan provide an in-","depth and up-to-date review of this complex area. Clinical features, pathogenesis, ","diagnosis, staging, and therapy are discussed. Newer therapeutic modalities ","including monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, interleukin-2 fusion toxin, and vaccines ","have been included.

Mycosis fungoides and the ","Sézary syndrome are the most common forms, with approximately ","1000 cases yearly. The median age at onset is 55 years, and the male ","predominance is 2:1. The etiology of mycosis fungoides is unknown. ","Infectious, genetic, and environmental sources have been proposed. ","Mycosis fungoides typically presents as patches or plaques that may ","progress to tumors over time. The Sézary syndrome is the leukemic ","variant of CTCL characterized by lymphadenopathy, generalized ","erythroderma, and severe pruritus. As the severity of involvement ","increases, spread to extracutaneous sites may occur. Diagnosis relies ","primarily on skin biopsy with routine histologic evaluation. Presently, ","there is no cure for CTCL. Current treatment includes topical therapy, ","phototherapy, radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy, and ","immunotherapy.

Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are ","the most common subsets of CTCL. Mycosis fungoides ","is distinguished from other CTCL by its unique ","clinical and histologic features. ","","In 1806 the French dermatologist Alibert first described ","mycosis fungoides in a patient with a skin ","eruption that progressed to mushroom-shaped tumors.1 ","Mycosis fungoides typically manifests as an indolent ","cutaneous eruption with erythematous scaly patches or ","plaques and may progress to generalized erythroderma, ","cutaneous tumors, or extracutaneous involvement. ","A pre-mycotic period with nonspecific scaly skin ","eruptions may precede the diagnosis of mycosis fungoides ","by several months to several years.2,3 Prognosis ","varies from prolonged survival to an aggressive, rapidly ","progressive, fatal outcome. ","","Sézary syndrome, described by Sézary and Bouvrain4 ","in 1938, is the leukemic variant of CTCL characterized ","by lymphadenopathy, generalized erythroderma, ","and severe pruritus. Neoplastic T cells (Sézary cells) ","can be found in the peripheral blood. Patients may present ","with all components of Sézary syndrome or with ","only one element, commonly erythroderma, and then ","progress to development of the other characteristic ","features. ","","Clinical Features ","","Mycosis fungoides often has a long indolent history. ","Early lesions may mimic an eczematous process and ","may require sequential biopsies to establish the diagnosis.","5 A pre-mycotic phase, with a median 6-year ","duration, often precedes the diagnosis of mycosis fungoides ","and Sézary syndrome.2 Patients may have many ","years of nonspecific skin lesions and nondiagnostic ","skin biopsy results. The lesions may respond to topical ","corticosteroids or may wax and wane even when ","untreated. Many patients in this pre-mycotic phase ","might never progress to mycosis fungoides, whereas ","characteristic patches and plaques with diagnostic skin ","biopsy results develop in others. The concept of parapsoriasis ","en plaques as a pre-mycosis fungoides process ","is controversial. ","","Curr Probl Dermatol 2001;13:301-40. ","doi:10.1067/mdm.2001.119860 ","","In 1876 Bazin proposed that mycosis fungoides falls ","into 3 general categories: nonspecific erythematous ","patches (pre-mycotic), infiltrated plaques (lichenoid), ","and tumors (fungoid).6 We now recognize 4 distinct ","skin lesions: patch, plaque, tumors, and erythroderma. ","These phases may be distinct or overlapping at diagnosis. ","Patches may be single or multiple and are erythematous ","and slightly scaly. Mycosis fungoides typically ","presents in a “bathing suit” distribution including ","the hips, buttocks, thighs, lower abdomen, axilla, and ","breasts,1,2,5,7 although any body surface may be affected. ","Patches may be asymptomatic or intensely pruritic. ","Repeated excoriation often results in secondary ","lichenification.2 ","","Plaques are well marginated, raised, and erythematous ","(Fig 1).5 They may arise from established patches ","or from unaffected skin. Plaques may be annular, ","angulated, or serpiginous. Leonine facies results from ","malignant T-cell infiltration leading to extensive thickening ","and skin-fold accentuation (Fig 2). Involvement ","of hairy surfaces may result in alopecia or follicular ","mucinosis. Disease can extend to the eyelids and the ","external auditory canals.2 The palms and soles can ","develop hyperkeratosis and skin fissuring.1,2 Dystrophic ","nails, poikiloderma, and hypopigmentation may ","also occur.2 Patients typically have intense pruritus. ","More extensive skin involvement can evolve into generalized ","erythroderma, l’homme rouge,2 involving the ","entire skin with or without exfoliation (Fig 3). ","","Tumors may develop from patches, from plaques, or ","de novo (Fig 4). Tumors more commonly arise on the ","face and body folds.5 Pruritus may be less severe with ","tumors. However, tumors often develop necrosis, ","ulcerate, and become infected. The rate of progression, ","if any, from patch to plaque to tumor is unpredictable.1 ","In 1885 Videl and Brocq8 described the tumors d’emblee ","variant as mycosis fungoides presenting with ","tumors. This form is rare, occurring in less than 5% to ","10% of patients with mycosis fungoides,5 and has ","been disputed by some as representing a lymphoma ","with secondary skin involvement; however, Blasik et ","al6 maintain that it is a distinct entity. The most common ","extracutaneous site of involvement is the lymph ","node.9 Extensive peripheral blood involvement can ","occur late in the disease.

The annual incidence ","of mycosis fungoides in the United States is ","","Curr Probl Dermatol, November/December 2001 ","","\f","estimated at 0.42 per 100,000,10 approximately 1000 ","new cases each year. The incidence increased from ","","0.19 cases per 100,000 in 1973 to 0.42 cases per ","100,000 in 1984.10 Furthermore, the proportion of all ","lymphomas identified as mycosis fungoides also ","increased during this period from 1.6% to 2.8%. This ","increase is not merely reflective of improved diagnostic ","criteria, as improved survival rates from earlier ","detection and treatment would be expected.13 Mycosis ","fungoides and Sézary syndrome are typically diseases ","of older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 55 ","years.2,5,11 Prevalence also rises sharply with advancing ","age.10,14 Mycosis fungoides is twice as common in ","men as women, and African Americans outnumber ","white patients 2.2:1.2,10 ","","Etiology ","","The etiology of mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome ","remains unknown. Formal case reports and ","studies have suggested infectious, genetic, and environmental ","sources. ","","Five viruses have been studied for linkage to CTCL: ","human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-I/II/V), herpes ","simplex virus, human herpesvirus 6, Epstein-Barr ","virus, and human immunodeficiency virus.1,15-17 ","Studies have focused on a causal relationship between ","HTLV-I and CTCL because HTLV-I is associated with ","CTCL/leukemia; however, HTLV-I antibodies have ","been found in fewer than 1 in 10 patients with mycosis ","fungoides.13,18 ","","Mycosis fungoides was thought by Alibert to be ","transmissible within a family.19 However, subsequent ","studies have found only 3 definitive cases of familial ","mycosis fungoides.19 Patients with mycosis fungoides ","and Sézary syndrome have been reported to have chromosomal ","abnormalities and oncogene alterations. A ","specific chromosomal abnormality at the region ","between 1p22 and 1p36 has been described in the progression ","or malignant transformation (or both) of ","mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome.20 Furthermore, ","an increased occurrence of HLA antigens B8 ","and Bw35 has been identified in some patients.21 ","Cytokines and growth factors have also been proposed ","in the pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides and Sézary ","syndrome. ","","Environmental toxins have been postulated to stimulate ","an abnormal immune response. Possible contributors ","include history of atopy, prior viral or fungal skin ","infections, family history of malignancy, sun sensitivity, ","toxin exposure, and a manufacturing occupation.22 ","","One study implicated multiple exposures to air pollutants, ","pesticides, solvents and vapors, detergents, ","tobacco, analgesics, tranquilizers, and thiazides.23 A ","case-control study by Tuyp et al24 investigated occupational, ","recreational, and chemical or environmental ","exposure to potential carcinogens and demonstrated ","no association with mycosis fungoides. Similarly, ","Whittemore et al25 found no association between ","patients with mycosis fungoides and control subjects ","with respect to occupational or chemical exposure. ","","Histopathology ","","Skin biopsy with routine histologic evaluation is the ","most important procedure for establishing the diagnosis ","of mycosis fungoides. Consensus for establishing ","histologic diagnostic criteria has yet to be reached. In ","the early patch phase, it may be difficult to distinguish ","mycosis fungoides from nonspecific chronic inflammation ","histologically, and sequential biopsies are often ","needed to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. Secondary ","alterations within mycosis fungoides lesions, including ","epidermal ulceration, secondary bacterial infection, ","and follicular mucinosis, may alter histopathologic ","appearance.2 The use of topical corticosteroids may ","make diagnosis difficult, and when there is strong clinical ","suspicion of CTCL, the patient should stop the use ","of corticosteroids for 2 to 4 weeks and then undergo ","repeat biopsy. As patients are treated with mechlorethamine, ","electron beam, or psoralen plus UV-A ","(PUVA), histologic changes occur. Biopsy specimens ","have a deeper infiltrate, more atypia, prominent fibrosis, ","increased melanophages, and spongiosis. ","","The earliest changes seen in mycosis fungoides include ","a sparse, superficial patchy or perivascular lymphocytic ","infiltrate, slight epidermotropism, and occasional ","spongiosis.2,26 Mycosis fungoides cells display ","a predilection for keratinocytes, perhaps due to interaction ","with Langerhans’ cells. Lymphocytic atypia, ","plasma cells, and eosinophils are rare.26 ","","Within plaques, lymphoid cells in the upper dermis ","have hyperchromatic, convoluted nuclei and scant ","cytoplasm.2 Mononuclear cells are found within the ","papillary dermis as isolated “haloed cells” or in the ","epidermis as collections surrounded by a clear halo, ","Pautrier’s microabscess, or microaggregation (Figs 5 ","and 6).5 There is psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia ","with hyperkeratosis and focal parakeratosis.5 Epidermotropism, ","basal cell layer predilection, lymphocytic ","atypia, and Pautrier’s microabscesses help distinguish ","CTCL from dermatitis.27 ","","\f","FIG 5.

","","In the tumor phase the infiltrate extends from the ","upper and lower dermis into the subcutaneous fat. ","Cells may undergo degrees of transformation and lose ","epidermotropic properties.9 A Grenz zone, a sparing of ","a thin superficial layer of papillary dermis from deeper ","malignant T cells, may appear.2 ","","The atypical lymphocyte found in mycosis fungoides ","and Sézary syndrome has a characteristic cerebriform ","nucleus. However, this nucleus is also found in benign ","dermatologic disorders such as solar keratoses, atopic ","dermatitis, psoriasis, and lichen planus.28 The nuclear ","contour index was developed to correlate the degree of ","nuclear convolution with malignancy.29 Reactive T-","cell processes have low nuclear contour index values, ","whereas mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome ","have higher values, but substantial overlap exists.

","Immunohistochemistry has been most useful in discerning ","cutaneous lymphoma lineages as T or B cell.31 ","Malignant T cells typically display epidermotropism, ","whereas malignant B cells are usually separated from ","the epidermis.32 ","","Normal cutaneous T cells predominantly express ","CD2, CD3, CD45RO, and CLA.33 As cells undergo ","malignant transformation, loss of cell-surface proteins ","can be identified. The pan-T-cell antigen most commonly ","absent is CD7 (Leu9), followed by CD2, CD3, ","and CD5.32 The absence of CD7 has been shown to ","represent an expansion of a T-cell population not ","expressing the antigen rather than the loss of antigen ","from existing cells.34 Loss of CD7 expression is also ","identified in 10% to 20% of benign cutaneous T-cell ","processes,2 so this finding is not diagnostic of mycosis ","fungoides or Sézary syndrome. ","","The T-cell receptor has been an area of intense ","research because it confers specificity to antigen ","expression.35 The T-cell receptor is a disulfide-linked ","heterodimer composed of 1 of 2 protein complexes, αβ ","or γ-δ.31,36 During T-cell maturation, the γ-δ complex ","undergoes the first gene rearrangement. If this does ","not yield a viable protein, the α-β complex then undergoes ","rearrangement as well.37 Molecular techniques ","may demonstrate a clonal gene rearrangement. Clonality ","is demonstrable in 75% of CTCL but also in ","approximately 5% of benign processes.38 Polymerase ","chain reaction (PCR) can also be used to establish the ","diagnosis of CTCL and in the evaluation of clinical ","","Curr Probl Dermatol, November/December 2001 ","","\f","TABLE 1.

","Southern blot analysis, which has been shown to ","detect circulating T-cell clones at levels of 1% of the ","circulating population,37 can be used in cases in which ","flow cytometry is equivocal. Southern blot analysis ","identifies T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin gene ","rearrangements through the presence of expanded T-","cell clones; however, its clinical utility is limited ","because a tumor concentration of less than 5% of the ","sample cells may produce a negative result.32 PCR ","amplification of γ-chain T-cell receptor gene rearrangements ","can detect more than 90% of T-cell clone populations ","in skin biopsy specimens.38 This method requires ","tumor cell concentrations ranging from 0.001% ","to 1.0%, but it may detect similar rearrangements in ","reactive processes.32,33,38 The RNAase protection ","assay evaluates the messenger RNA (mRNA) of circulating ","lymphocytes for T-cell receptor analysis to ","demonstrate clonality. ","","Diagnosis and Evaluation ","","The initial evaluation for mycosis fungoides begins ","with a comprehensive history and physical examination ","with an emphasis on body distribution of lesions and ","lymph node, liver, and spleen examination. The diagnosis ","of mycosis fungoides relies primarily on biopsy of ","involved skin. Establishing a diagnosis may require ","multiple biopsies taken over months to years. Skin biopsy ","results are important in distinguishing early mycosis ","fungoides from benign processes, such as large plaque ","parapsoriasis,2 or other cutaneous lymphomas (Fig 7). ","In the setting of equivocal histology, laboratory testing ","(complete blood count [CBC] including smear examination ","for Sézary cells), flow cytometry, immunoperoxidase ","for T-cell marker loss, and evaluation of T-cell ","receptor gene rearrangement may help to confirm the ","diagnosis. However, the diagnosis is best made by histology, ","and therefore repeat biopsy every 6 to 12 months ","when one’s clinical suspicion is high is not unreasonable. ","Regular imaging is not recommended. ","","Repeat evaluation during follow-up of patients with ","CTCL consists of an updated history and physical ","examination, including evaluation for lymphadenopathy ","and hepatosplenomegaly, and laboratory tests ","(peripheral blood smear for Sézary cells and serum ","lactate dehydrogenase). Repeat skin biopsy after diagnosis ","may be necessary when a patient has recurrence ","after therapy or development of new lesions such as ","tumors. When palpable lymphadenopathy exists, biopsy ","or fine needle aspiration is indicated. If visceral ","involvement is suggested by a review of systems or ","physical examination, further appropriate imaging and ","histologic evaluations may be pursued. Because ","Sézary cells are not commonly identified in peripheral ","blood, their presence reflects significant bone marrow ","involvement and, therefore, bone marrow biopsy is not ","usually helpful.11 ","","Classification ","","Historically, CTCL classification has lacked consensus. ","Different classifications used have included ","the Kiel, Working Formulation, and Lukes-Collins ","lymphoma classifications.32 In 1994 a revised lymphoma ","classification was established that incorporated ","morphologic, immunologic, and genetic features. ","This classification, the Revised European-American ","Lymphoma Classification (REAL), was created by the ","International Lymphoma Study Group. Thereafter the ","European Organization for Research and Treatment of ","Cancer (EORTC) Lymphoma Program Project Group ","designed a classification specifically for primary cutaneous ","lymphomas, with the additional consideration ","of clinical presentation and biologic behavior. Differences ","between the EORTC, Kiel, and REAL classifications ","are highlighted in Table 2.39 ","","Staging ","","A tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system for ","mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome was pro-","","\f","FIG 7. Spectrum of disease. ","","posed by the Mycosis Fungoides Cooperative Group ","in 1979.40 Modeled after the TNM classification system ","of the American Joint Committee on Cancer ","Staging, this system focused on skin stage (T), peripheral ","lymph node involvement (N), and visceral organ ","involvement (M). Peripheral blood involvement correlates ","with the extent of skin disease and the presence ","of lymph node involvement, but it is not considered to ","be an independent prognostic factor.2,40 ","","Since then, revisions have been proposed in an effort ","to better determine course and prognosis. In 1984 ","Lamberg et al41 described 4 clinical stages based only ","on physical examination to ascribe clinical prognosis ","in CTCL. This design is based on skin involvement ","(T0-T4) and extent of nodal involvement (N0-N8). ","Presently, the standard clinical staging system for ","CTCL is the TNMB classification (Tables 3 and 4), ","which is based on type and extent of skin involvement ","(T), lymph node involvement (N), presence of visceral ","disease (M), and detection of Sézary cells in the ","peripheral blood (B). This is a modification of the ","original TNM staging system by Sausville et al.42 ","","Patients are classified to clinical stages I through IV ","based on the extent of skin, node, and visceral disease ","involvement. Stage I disease is limited to the skin (limited ","patch or plaque disease \u003c10% of total skin surface ","[IA] and generalized patch or plaque disease ≥10% of ","total skin surface [IB]). Stage II disease is subdivided ","into patch or plaque disease with palpable lymphadenopathy ","(IIA) and cutaneous tumors with or without ","palpable lymphadenopathy (IIB). Stage III disease is ","generalized erythroderma with (IIIA) or without (IIIB) ","palpable lymphadenopathy. Stage IV disease is characterized ","by extracutaneous involvement (limited to ","lymph nodes [IVA] and visceral involvement [IVB]). ","The B (blood) classification does not alter clinical ","stage. Staging is important. As we will discuss later, ","therapy choices are mostly determined by the stage of ","disease. ","","Prognosis ","","Results from a multicenter study of 152 patients ","suggested that 3 distinctive prognostic groups existed: ","good risk, intermediate risk, and poor risk.42 Good risk ","(stages IA, IB, and IIA) includes patch or plaque skin ","lesions without lymph node, peripheral blood, or visceral ","involvement with a median survival of more than ","12 years. Intermediate risk (stages IIB, III, and IVA) ","includes plaques, tumors, or erythroderma with lymph ","node or blood involvement but no visceral involvement. ","These patients have a median survival of 5 years. ","Poor risk (stage IVB) includes visceral involvement or ","complete lymph node effacement, and the median survival ","falls to 2.5 years.42 Interest in classification rests ","on its utility in assessing prognosis and treatment of ","CTCL patients. ","","Studies focusing on prognostic indicators of mycosis ","fungoides have consistently demonstrated that the T ","stage is the most important determinant of survival. ","Stage T1 (skin involvement) has an excellent prognosis, ","whereas stages T3 (tumor) and T4 (erythrodermic) ","have poor prognoses. Similarly, lymph node or visceral ","involvement or the presence of Sézary cells also carries ","a poor prognosis. The clinical course is best predicted ","by assessment of the proliferating T cells: ","tumor burden, degree of atypia, and host immunocompetence.","43 Median survival data studies from Stanford ","University demonstrated that nearly all patients with ","T1 disease died from causes unrelated to mycosis fungoides, ","whereas patients with T2, T3, and T4 disease ","demonstrated median survivals of 11 years, 3.2 years, ","and 4.6 years, respectively.11,44 ","","Identified adverse prognostic markers include the ","presence of cutaneous tumors, generalized erythroderma, ","lymph node enlargement or effacement, Sézary ","cells, eosinophilia, or visceral involvement.

","","Background ","","A cutaneous angiosarcoma (synonyms: lymphangiosarcoma ","and haemangiosarcoma) is a rare malignant tumour ","of vascular endothelial cells. It occurs predominantly in ","the elderly and is confined to the face and the scalp region ","in more than 50% of cases [1]. Despite the aggressive ","behaviour and poor prognosis, the diagnosis is often ","delayed due to its variable and often benign clinical ","appearance. This case documents a facial cutaneous angiosarcoma ","in an elderly male patient, revealing the diagnostic ","and therapeutic dilemma of this entity, which ","shows an unfavourable clinical course in spite of multi-","modal therapy. ","","Case report ","","A 64-year-old man presented with a six month history of ","a recurrent diffuse and erythematous painless swelling (3 ","× 2 cm2) below the left eye to the Department of Dermatology, ","Regensburg University, Germany. Cervical lymphadenopathy ","was clinically not detectable. Routine ","laboratory results showed no abnormality.

","","","tiated. Because of the persistence of the lesion, an incisional ","biopsy was performed three weeks later (Figure 1). ","Histopathology of the specimen showed an invasively ","growing tumour of the dermis, composed of atypical vascular ","endothelia in a disordered manner, forming bizarre ","vascular lumina. The tumor cells were characterized by an ","elevated proliferated activity with a proliferation fraction ","(MIB-1) of 5%–10%. The vascular endothelial proliferation ","showed a papillary architecture accompanied by ","small lymphocytes. The majority of endothelial cells presented ","a hyperchromatic nucleus and a swollen cytoplasm. ","(Figure 2a, 2b, 2c). Immunohistochemical studies ","demonstrated positivity for CD 31 (Figure 2d) and factor ","VIII-related antigen. Based on these findings the diagnosis ","of a cutaneous angiosarcoma was made. ","","After referral of the patient to the Department of Oral and ","Maxillofacial Surgery, Regensburg University, Germany, ","the tumour was removed by wide local surgical excision ","(Figure 3) and the defect was temporarily covered by Epigard. ","Despite negative intraoperative frozen section margins, ","positive margins were repeatedly detected later on ","permanent sections. Negative margins on permanent section ","were finally reached after three resections and ","infraorbital soft tissue was plastically reconstructed with a ","buccal rotation flap. After surgery, chemotherapy followed ","with six cycles of alpha-interferon. ","","Five months later a periorbital redness and swelling on ","both sides (Figure 4) required another incisional biopsy, ","which was confirmed as recurrent angiosarcoma on histopathological ","examination. Imaging staging procedures ","(MRI and CT head-neck, CT chest, CT abdomen, PET and ","bone scan) found bone invasion to the nasal root (Figure ","5). Metastases to the neck lymph nodes as well as distant ","metastases were clinically and radiologically excluded. ","","Neither radiochemotherapy with a cumulative radiation ","dose of 64.8 Gy and seven cycles Doxorubicin nor an ","additional antiangiogenetic therapy with Trofosfamide, ","Pioglitazone, Rofecoxibe and steroids could prevent the ","rapid tumour progression. The patient died 21 months ","after the first diagnosis. ","","Discussion ","","There are three main types of cutaneous angiosarcoma: ","Idiopathic angiosarcoma of the head and neck in elderly ","patients, lymphoedema-associated angiosarcoma (Stewart-","Treves-Syndrome) and postirradiation angiosarcoma ","[2]. Besides an association with persistent chronic lymphoedema, ","previous irradiation and pre-existing vascular ","malformation, little is known regarding the causative factors ","of that disease [3]. With respect to pathogenesis, ","among others, upregulation of the glykopeptide VEGF-D, ","a vascular endothelial growth factor, seems to be responsible ","for the endothelial cell proliferation [4]. ","","Clinically the appearance of a cutaneous angiosarcoma of ","the skin and scalp can be variable. Early lesions most commonly ","present as single or multifocal ill-defined, bruise-","like erythematous-purplish areas with indurated borders ","[5]. In the present case, akin to those previously described ","by others [6,7], these haematoma-like lesions can be misinterpreted ","as benign inflammatory or allergic hyperemias. ","More advanced lesions can present as dark bluish, ","sometimes keratotic papules or nodules with ulceration ","and bleeding, mimicking other malignancies like squamous ","cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, malignant ","melanoma, lymphoma as well as metastases [3,5,8]. ","","Microscopically a cutaneous angiosarcoma is typically ","characterized by numerous, irregular and anastomosing ","vascular channels. These are lined by pleomorphic, hyper-","","Page 2 of 5 ","","(page number not for citation purposes) ","","\f","Head \u0026 Face Medicine 2008, 4:18 http://www.head-face-med.com/content/4/1/18 ","","","Figure 2 ","Histopathology. a: Overview image: Epidermis, followed by dermis with hair follicles and sebaceous glands.

","","chromatic endothelial cells with variable mitotic activity ","[9]. Immunhistochemical positivity for the endothelial ","markers CD 31 and factor VIII-related antigen as well as ","for the transcription factor Fli-1 may help to establish ","diagnosis [10,11]. The differential diagnosis includes ","hemangioma, especially tufted, cavernous and epithelioid ","hemangioma on the one hand and acantholytic carcinoma ","on the other hand. Especially in immunocompromised ","patients Kaposi-sarcoma might be a further ","differential diagnosis. In the current case the presence of ","many lymphocytes might be a hint to regard the lesion as ","of lymphatic vessel origin, i.e. as a lymphangiosarcoma. ","","Treatment of the cutaneous angiosarcoma is generally ","based on radical surgery and postoperative radiation therapy. ","Surgery is postulated to attain a wide excision of the ","tumour with histologically negative margins [1,4]. Unfortunately ","achieving negative margins is difficult, as multi-","focal and extensive microscopic spread is common in this ","disease. Intraoperative frozen sections are often performed ","to assist in determining section margins. Pawlik et ","al. [5] demonstrated, however, an overall negative predictive ","value of only 33.3% for that procedure, which ","explains the repeating surgical resections in the case ","report. For this reason, temporary reconstruction with ","homografts or skin substitutes is recommended until the ","definite histological confirmation of margin status. Since ","up to 78% of the patients still have residual tumour after ","wide and multiple surgical resections [5,12], this goal of ","achieving histologically negative section margins remains ","","Page 3 of 5 ","","(page number not for citation purposes) ","","\f","Head \u0026 Face Medicine 2008, 4:18 http://www.head-face-med.com/content/4/1/18 ","","Figure 3 ","Clinical finding after first surgery: Intraoperative ","defect, 4 × 2.5 cm2 in size.

","","More recently, chemotherapy and gene therapy are ","increasingly available. Doxorubicin is reported to be ","active in angiosarcoma [13], but did not show response in ","the present patient. Paclitaxel is another agent, that seems ","to have substantial effects, even in patients, who were ","treated previously with chemotherapy or radiation therapy ","[2,14]. In more palliative situations, antiangiogentic ","therapy with pioglitazone, rofecoxib and metronomic trofosfamide ","has been recommended [15]. ","","Conclusion ","","Despite multimodal therapy options, prognosis of the ","cutaneous angiosarcoma is still poor, with a 5-year-survival ","rate between 12% and 33%. About half of the ","patients are dying within 15 to 18 months of presentation ","[1,5,16].

The prognosis of advanced EMPD is ","not favorable; thus, the development of potential treatments has long been sought. ","Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib and palbociclib ","have been proven effective against metastatic breast cancer; however, no studies ","have addressed CDK4/6 inhibitors as an EMPD treatment. We herein examine the ","efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors against an EMPD patient-derived xenograft (PDX) ","model. Abemaciclib (50 mg/kg/day) or palbociclib (120 mg/kg/day) was given orally to ","tumor-bearing NOD/Scid mice over a 3-week period. We also investigated the protein ","expression levels of CDK4/6 and cyclin D1 through immunohistochemical staining ","using EMPD clinical samples. Treatment with abemaciclib or palbociclib as a single ","agent was found to significantly suppress tumor growth in EMPD-PDX. The Ki-67positive ","ratio of the treated EMPD-PDX tumors was significantly lower than that of ","the nontreated tumors. Clinically, the expression levels of CDK4 and cyclin D1 were ","significantly higher in the EMPD tumor cells than in the normal epidermis. Our results ","suggest that CDK4/6 inhibitors could be novel and potent therapeutics for the treatment ","of EMPD.

","","3.2 | ExpressionlevelsofCDK4andcyclinD1arehighinEMPD ","","","The results of the therapeutic experiments using EMPD-PDX ","prompted us to examine the CDK4 expression in clinical samples ","of EMPD. Immunohistochemically, the expression levels of CDK4 in ","EMPD tumor cells were higher than in normal epidermal keratinocytes ","or adnexal epithelium (hair follicles and sweat glands; Figure 4, ","*P \u003c ",".01). The expression levels of CDK4 in lymph node metastatic ","tumor cells were also higher than in normal epidermis. These results ","are consistent with the previous study by Urata et al.20 Next, we ","assessed the expression levels of cyclin D1 in EMPD tumors. The ","EMPD primary tumor cells showed higher cyclin D1 expression levels ","than normal epidermis (Figure S2). To examine the clinical significance ","of high expression levels of CDK4 and cyclin D1 in EMPD, ","we assessed the correlations between immunostaining results and ","clinical information. No correlation was observed between CDK4/ ","cyclin D1 expression and clinical stage in EMPD (data not shown). ","","4 | DISCUSSION ","","","Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors are powerful therapeutics ","for cancer treatment, especially breast cancer. In preclinical models, ","","\f","CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown positive results against many kinds ","of tumors, including colon cancer, glioblastomas, prostate carcinomas, ","sarcomas, pancreatic adenocarcinomas, melanomas, and nonsmall-","cell lung cancer.11 Based on the preclinical evidence, clinical ","trials using CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib and abemaciclib) as single ","agents have been undertaken as a treatment for solid tumors, including ","sarcomas, thymic epithelial tumors, gastrointestinal stromal ","tumors, brain tumors, teratomas, and head and neck squamous cell ","carcinomas.11 In the dermatologic field, clinical investigations of the ","concurrent inhibition of MEK and CDK4/6 have been carried out ","using data from patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma.21 It is our ","hope that in several years the results of ongoing clinical trials will ","provide novel treatment options for many kinds of solid tumors. ","","As the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibition is limited by resistance ","mechanisms, combined therapeutic strategies have been studied. ","Through in vitro and in vivo investigations, some of the molecular ","mechanisms associated with resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition have ","been elucidated.22 In breast cancer, the HER2 pathway has been ","thought to be a resistance mechanism, as HER2 activation correlates ","with resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors.22 Additionally, activation of ","the CDK4 pathway contributes to resistance to HER2-directed therapies.","23 It has been reported that CDK4/6 inhibitors and anti-HER2 ","therapies have synergistic effects on model mice with breast cancer.","24 Furthermore, recent clinical studies found the combination ","therapy of CDK4/6 inhibitors and trastuzumab had promising results ","for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancers.24,25 The expression ","levels of CDK4 and cyclin D1 are high in EMPD (Figure 4); ","furthermore, pathogenic ERBB2 mutations and/or higher expression ","levels of HER2 protein are detected in some EMPD cases. In light of ","the above, not only could CDK4/6-targeted therapies be promising ","as single-agent therapies against advanced EMPD with HER2 activation, ","but they could also be promising therapies in combination ","with anti-HER2 Abs. Our study currently has the limitation that we ","have established only one EMPD-PDX model,7 and we used it to ","evaluate the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors. We are now working on ","establishing other EMPD-PDX models and will verify our results in ","the future. ","","In conclusion, the present study indicates that CDK4/6 inhibitors ","suppress tumor growth in EMPD-PDX, suggesting that these drugs ","could be promising treatment options for advanced EMPD patients.

An increasing number of deep ","sequencing studies of MCC have identified significant differences between the number and types of point ","mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variants between virus-positive and virus-negative tumors. ","However, it has been challenging to reliably distinguish between virus positive and UV damaged MCC. ","","Methods: In this study, we assembled a cohort of 71 MCC patients and performed deep sequencing with OncoPanel, ","a clinically implemented, next-generation sequencing assay targeting over 400 cancer-associated genes. To improve ","the accuracy and sensitivity for virus detection compared to traditional PCR and IHC methods, we developed a hybrid ","capture baitset against the entire MCPyV genome and software to detect integration sites and structure. ","","Results: Sequencing from this approach revealed distinct integration junctions in the tumor genome and generated ","assemblies that strongly support a model of microhomology-initiated hybrid, virus-host, circular DNA intermediate that ","promotes focal amplification of host and viral DNA. Using the clear delineation between virus-positive and virus-","negative tumors from this method, we identified recurrent somatic alterations common across MCC and alterations ","specific to each class of tumor, associated with differences in overall survival. Finally, comparing the molecular and ","clinical data from these patients revealed a surprising association of immunosuppression with virus-negative MCC and ","significantly shortened overall survival. ","","Conclusions: These results demonstrate the value of high-confidence virus detection for identifying molecular ","mechanisms of UV and viral oncogenesis in MCC. Furthermore, integrating these data with clinical data revealed ","features that could impact patient outcome and improve our understanding of MCC risk factors.

Risk factors for developing ","MCC include advanced age, light skin color with ","excessive sunlight exposure, and a variety of immunocompromised ","conditions [1]. In 2008, Merkel cell polyomavirus ","(MCPyV) was first detected by Southern blot in some ","but not all MCC tumors with integration of viral DNA occurring ","at several different chromosomal sites. Importantly, ","an identical clonal integration pattern was detected ","in one primary tumor and corresponding metastatic ","lymph node [2]. This important insight implied that integration ","of the viral DNA was an early if not initiating ","event in virus-positive MCC oncogenesis. MCPyV infects ","most people, typically at an early age, and results in an ","asymptomatic and lifelong infection indicated by the persistent ","presence of antibodies to the viral coat protein VP1 ","[3, 4]. Although MCPyV DNA can be readily detected on ","the skin, the cell types where the virus replicates in vivo ","have not been determined [5]. ","","Since the original discovery of MCPyV, it has become increasingly ","clear that virus-positive MCC has a different etiology ","than virus-negative, UV-associated, MCC [1]. Virus-","positive MCC expresses the viral oncogenes large T antigen ","(LT) and small T antigen (ST) and the tumor genome ","usually contains very few mutations in cellular oncogenes ","and tumor suppressor genes. In contrast, studies using ","whole exome or targeted hybrid capture sequencing have ","revealed that virus-negative MCC has an exceptionally high ","somatic mutation load predominated by UV-mediated mutations ","with frequent mutations in RB1, TP53, NOTCH1, ","and FAT1 [6, 7]. Wholegenomesequencing(WGS) of ","MCC confirmed virus-positive MCC exhibits a globally ","lower, non-UV-mediated, mutation burden as well as few ","somatic copy number amplifications, deletions, and rearrangements ","compared to virus-negative MCC, while providing ","new insights into the structure and mechanism of ","virus integration [8]. ","","Accurate detection of the presence of MCPyV and distinguishing ","between virus-positive and virus-negative ","MCC is important for insight into the oncogenesis, cell-","of-origin, and therapeutic options. Currently, there is no ","routine clinical effort to distinguish between virus-","positive MCC and virus-negative MCC. Several recent ","studies have suggested differences between virus-positive ","MCC and virus-negative MCC in presentation, age, and ","response to immunotherapy [9–15]. However, current ","techniques for determining viral status have yielded either ","inaccurate or ambiguous results. Although WGS ","provides much more genetic information on the tumor ","and viral genome compared to targeted approaches, it ","remains impractical for clinical evaluation of MCC. ","","The most common methods for detection of MCPyV ","in MCC include PCR amplification of MCPyV DNA ","from DNA isolated from MCC tumors or immunohistochemistry ","(IHC) staining for MCPyV LT using monoclonal ","antibodies CM2B4 and Ab3 [16, 17]. However, both ","PCR and IHC have been shown to be unreliable in distinguishing ","between virus-positive from virus-negative ","MCC. For example, a recent study of 282 cases of MCC ","evaluated virus positivity by IHC with monoclonal antibodies ","CM2B4 and Ab3 or by PCR with a previously validated ","primer set [18]. Notably, there was concordance ","for all three assays in only 167 of 282 (59.2%) cases with ","an additional 62 cases positive for two of the three tests. ","The remaining 53 (18.8%) were positive for one test or ","none. This study assigned the MCC to be virus-positive ","if two or three tests were positive, implying that detection ","of viral DNA by PCR alone was not sufficient for a ","tumor to be called virus-positive MCC. Furthermore, because ","of the sensitivity of PCR in detecting DNA, a ","lower limit of 0.01 copy of MCPyV DNA per tumor cell ","was called virus-positive MCC. Tumors containing \u003c ","","0.01 viral copies/cell were called virus-negative. A different ","study using RNA-ISH to detect mRNA specific for ","MCPyV LT and ST found this method to be as sensitive ","as qPCR when using two primer sets and the viral copy ","number was set to \u003e 0.004/cell [19]. The AMERCK test ","detects circulating antibodies against the MCPyV ST ","[20]. The sensitivity of this test is low for detection of ","virus-positive MCC but, when positive, can be used as a ","biomarker for disease status [20]. ","","The high somatic mutation burden in virus-negative ","MCC is predicted to yield more tumor neoantigens than ","melanomas or non-small cell lung cancers (median of 173, ","65, and 111 neoantigens/sample, respectively) [21][22]. ","As observed for other tumor types, the high neoantigen ","burden in virus-negative MCC corresponds to a higher ","degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in some tumors, ","but these tumors also express PD-L1 rendering these lymphocytes ","ineffective [7]. Despite the numerous observed ","differences in mutation rate and number of predicted ","neoantigens, both virus-positive MCC and virus-negative ","MCC tumors have shown high response rates to PD-L1 ","and PD1 checkpoint blockade therapy [14, 15]. ","","For further advancements to be made in understanding ","MCC, especially for patients not responsive to current ","therapies, clear and accurate determination of the MCPyV ","virus status and actionable variants in these tumors are required. ","In this study, we developed a viral hybrid capture ","next-generation sequencing (NGS) method to detect the ","presence of integrated MCPyV DNA in FFPE clinical ","specimens for routine use in a clinical setting. This approach ","was combined with targeted sequencing of several ","hundred cancer-related genes to assess oncogenic changes ","in the tumor genome. Lastly, we compared the sensitivity ","and accuracy of this viral hybrid capture approach to more ","traditional approaches, PCR detection of viral DNA, IHC ","","\f","Starrett et al.

","","Methods ","","Study design and participants ","","This study included all patients (n = 71) with a reported ","diagnosis of MCC at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s ","Cancer Center who underwent comprehensive genomic ","profiling by OncoPanel between May 2013 and April ","2018. OncoPanel version 3 (POPv3) is a custom hybrid ","capture assay targeting the exons of 447 genes and 191 regions ","across 60 genes commonly rearranged in cancer [23, ","24]. A retrospective chart review collected demographic, ","clinical, disease, treatment, and outcome variables on all ","71 patients.

","","Nucleic acid isolation, library preparation and sequencing ","","To perform ViroPanel with and without supplementation ","with the OncoPanel (v3) bait set, purified DNA was quantified ","using a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay (Thermo ","Fisher).

Captures were done using the SureSelectXT Fast ","target enrichment assay (Agilent, Technologies, Santa ","Clara, CA) with ViroPanel with and without supplementation ","with the OncoPanel (v3) bait set. Captures were sequenced ","on an Illumina 2500 in rapid run mode (Illumina ","Inc., San Diego, CA). ","","Sequence alignment and somatic variant calling ","","Pooled samples were de-multiplexed and sorted using ","Illumina’s bcl2fastq software (v2.17).

The ","viral genomes and human genome were combined into ","one alignment reference so reads could map to the closest ","matching reference sequence. ","","Duplicate reads were identified using unique molecular ","indices (UMIs) and marked using the Picard tools. The ","alignments were further refined using the Genome Analysis ","Toolkit (GATK) for localized realignment around ","indel sites and base quality score recalibration [27, 28]. ","","Mutation analysis for single nucleotide variants (SNV) ","was performed using MuTect v1.1.4 (CEPH control was ","used as the “project normal”) and annotated by Variant ","Effect Predictor v 79 (VEP) [29, 30].

After initial identification of SNVs and indels by ","MuTect and GATK respectively, the variants were annotated ","using OncoAnnotate to determine what genes were ","impacted and their effect on the amino acid sequence. ","OncoAnnotate also applied additional filters using the Exome ","Sequencing Project (ESP) and gnomAD datasets to ","flag common SNPs. ","","Variants that affect protein coding regions underwent ","further filtering/classification based on frequency in the ","gnomAD, ESP, and COSMIC (version 80) databases. If the ","frequency of the variant was less than or equal to 1% in all ","gnomAD and ESP populations, the variant was flagged as ","“REVIEW_REQUIRED”. If the frequency of the variant ","was greater than 1% and less than or equal to 10% in all ","gnomAD and ESP populations and present in “COSMIC” ","database at least two times, the variant was flagged as “REVIEW_","REQUIRED”. If the frequency of the variant was ","between 1% and less than or equal to 10% in all gnomAD ","and ESP populations and not present in “COSMIC” database ","at least two times, the variant is flagged as “NO_REVIEW_","GERMLINE_FILTER”. If the frequency of the ","variant was greater than 10% in any gnomAD and ESP ","populations, the variant was flagged as “NO_REVIEW_ ","GERMLINE_FILTER”. Variants with a frequency greater ","than 10% in any gnomAD or ESP population were considered ","to be a common SNP irrespective of presence in the ","COSMIC database. ","","Variants in the viral genomes were called using samtools ","mpileup and bcftools from the aligned bam files.

Variants ","were annotated based on the NC_010277.2 reference ","sequence in GenBank using SnpEff [31]. ","","Recurrent copy number analysis ","","Copy number variant calling was performed using a combination ","of VisCap Cancer and CNVkit as previously described ","[32, 33].

","","Viral integration analysis ","","A custom perl script was written to extract, assemble, annotate, ","and visualize viral reads and determine viral integration ","sites.

The human genome positions for ","any read with a mate mapping to the viral genome were ","output into a bed file and the orientation of viral and human ","pairs was stored to accurately deconvolute overlapping ","integration sites. This bed file was then merged down ","into overlapping ranges based on orientation counting the ","number of reads overlapping that range. Skewdness in ","coverage of integration junctions was calculated by the ","difference in the fraction of virus-host read pairs overlapping ","the first and second halves of the aforementioned ","ranges. This skewdness value was used to determine the ","orientation of the viral-host junction (i.e., positive values, ","junction is on the 3′ end of the range; negative values, ","junction is on the 5′ end of the range), which was validated ","from the results of de novo assembly. Integrated ","viral genomes were assembled from extracted reads using ","SPAdes with default parameters [37].

Genomic ","studies were performed using DNA isolated from tumors ","obtained at the time of initial diagnosis (n=50) or ","upon relapse (n=21). The total number of mutations ranged ","from 0 to 73 corresponding to a tumor mutational burden ","(TMB; mutations/megabase) from 0 to 38.89 with four ","cases containing no detectable mutations (Fig. 1a, ","Additional file 1: Table S1). From this mutation data, patients ","were binned into TMB-high (≥ 20), TMB-","intermediate (\u003e 6 \u003c 20), and TMB-low (≤ 6). A limited set of ","mutation signatures could be identified (see “Methods”). ","The UV mutational signature (Signature 7) was detected in ","24 cases, corresponding to the TMB-high patients [40]. ","Additional mutational signatures identified included Aging ","(Signature 1; 3 cases), APOBEC (Signatures 2 and 13; 4 ","cases with 3 that also had an UV signature), and Signature 5 ","(one case) (Fig. 1a, Additional file 1: Table S1). TMB had ","some correlation with the number of copy number altered ","genes (Fig. 1b).

","","Copy number variants (CNVs) were examined individually ","as well as against each other and other likely ","functional somatic changes for significant co-occurrence ","or mutual exclusivity (Additional file 1: Table S2). Clusters ","of significantly co-occurrent CNVs were determined ","via network analysis (Fig. 2a, Additional file 2: Fig. S2 \u0026 ","Fig. S3). From these analyses, two distinct CNV clusters ","were each found to be altered in more than 36% of cases ","(Fig. 2b, c). Chromosome 10 (cluster 14) had frequent ","copy number loss with 26 tumors showing heterozygous ","or homozygous loss of the chromosome (Fig. 2b) [41]. ","Some cancer-relevant genes on chromosome 10 include ","PTEN and SUFU, negative regulators of PI3K and ","Hedgehog signaling respectively, with deletions reported ","in prior studies of MCC [41, 42]. A region of Chr1q ","(cluster 13) was amplified in 28 cases. This region includes ","MDM4 (also known as MDMX), whose protein ","product cooperates with MDM2 to promote the ubiquitination ","and subsequent degradation of p53 (Fig. 2b) [43, ","44]. In addition, we observed a focal amplification of ","MYCL within a greater amplification of Chr1p (cluster ","4), which was reported in an earlier study of MCC [45]. ","","CNV clusters 13 and 14 were observed at nearly equal ","frequencies in both TMB-high and TMB-low cases ","(Fig. 2b, c). Six other CNV clusters were strongly associated ","with UV signature and high TMB (Fig. 2c). Functional ","annotation of the clusters revealed that the two ","largest UV-associated CNV clusters (1 and 3) had significant ","enrichment for genes related broadly to DNA damage ","response and S-phase DNA damage checkpoint likely ","enhancing tolerance for UV mutagenesis. ","","Cluster 5, corresponding to 6p22.3 to 6q26 and likely ","representing a gain of the entire chromosome 6, was the ","only cluster more than twice as frequent in TMB-low tumors ","than TMB-high tumors (Fig. 2c).

Heterozygous loss of ","chromosome 10 (cluster 14) was observed in 26/71 MCC ","including both virus-positive and virus-negative tumors. ","Loss of chromosome 10 likely reduces PTEN levels contributing ","to activation of the PI3K signaling pathway. ","","A recurrent amplification of chromosome 6 has previously ","been observed for MCC; however, this observation ","predated the discovery of MCPyV and was not associated ","with morphology or outcome [55]. In other cancers, such ","as basal cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer, this amplification ","is typically associated with worse outcome [55]. Although ","the chromosome 6 amplification in this study was ","significantly associated with better overall survival, it was ","also more frequent in metastasis. This amplification contains ","genes such as VEGFA, which promotes angiogenesis ","and has been observed to be expressed at higher levels in ","distant ovarian cancer metastases [56]. Interestingly, further ","analysis of genes that are more abundantly mutated in the ","sequenced metastatic lesions, revealed statistically significant ","(q =2.47× 10− 7) pathway enrichment for angiogenesis ","as well as EGFR signaling and p53 dysregulation. FANCE is ","also carried on this chromosome and as a DNA damage response ","gene act to limit number of point mutations and ","copy number changes observed in virus-positive MCC, hindering ","tumor evolution. Together, this amplification co-","occurring with MCPyV may represent a less fatal, but more ","metastatic subtype of MCC. Additionally, this result could ","be impacted by diagnosis, treatment, or study recruitment ","of metastatic MCC. ","","Unexpectedly, we observed that 8 of 10 cases with immunosuppression ","were virus-negative MCC. While it ","was recognized in the early 1990s that individuals with ","hematologic malignancies that developed MCC had a ","poor prognosis [57], it was not until 1997 when a direct ","link between immunosuppression and MCC was postulated ","[58]. At that time, a correlation was noted between ","medically induced immunosuppression with azathioprine ","and cyclosporine and the development and rapid ","spread of MCC. Early reports highlighted a prolonged ","period of immunosuppression prior to MCC development. ","Notably, the search for a viral pathogen in MCC ","was initiated because of reports linking MCC with immunosuppression ","and with HIV-1/AIDS [2]. A subsequent ","report has shown similar rates of MCPyVpositivity ","in immunocompetent and suppressed patients, ","but relied on PCR and IHC for virus detection [18]. ","","In the present report, three solid organ transplant recipients, ","three with chronic autoimmune diseases, and two ","with hematologic malignancies developed virus-negative ","","\f","Starrett et al.

The increased risk for skin cancers in organ transplant ","recipients and rheumatoid arthritis is associated with ","UV-light-induced mutagenesis for SCC and BCC. Therefore, ","the increased risk for UV-induced skin cancers may ","also extend to virus-negative MCC. Although this study is ","one of the largest molecular studies on MCC genetics to ","date, the small sample size and inherent confounding factors ","of studying outcome in a cancer that manifests in ","older populations are important limitations. This also ","highlights the need for accurate determination of virus status ","and importance to continue to study this rare cancer to ","fully address the involvement of immune suppression on ","the etiology and outcome of this aggressive cancer. ","","Despite the significant differences in the TMB between ","virus-positive and virus-negative MCC, there were few ","phenotypic differences in the two types of MCC. Based ","on histopathological features alone, two subtypes of ","MCC can be recognized: pure neuroendocrine tumors ","","\f","Starrett et al. Genome Medicine (2020) 12:30 Page 20 of 22 ","","","and combined tumors with neuroendocrine and divergent ","(mainly squamous) differentiation. Most pure tumors ","are MCPyV-positive and CK20-positive while ","combined tumors are uniformly MCPyV-negative and ","occasionally CK-20 negative [9, 65]. Virus-negative MCC ","can also present as pure neuroendocrine-type MCC. ","","While genomic sequencing has revealed that virus-","negative MCC has evidence for a high degree of UV ","damage, this does not exclude a role for UV exposure in ","the development of virus-positive MCC. The relative ","lack of UV damaged DNA in virus-positive MCC indicates ","that the etiologies are clearly different, suggesting ","that the precursor to virus-negative MCC was a recipient ","of lifelong intense UV exposure while the virus-positive ","MCC were not exposed to sunlight for the same degree ","or for as long. It was reported that the early promoter of ","MCPyV responds to UV exposure and that levels of ST ","mRNA increased in UV exposed skin from a healthy human ","volunteer [66]. Transient UV exposure could affect ","the immune response to virus-negative and virus-","positive MCC etiology. The effect of UV radiation in the ","pathogenesis of MCC has been suggested to be more ","likely a result of immune modulation rather than direct ","effects on DNA itself [67]. ","","Conclusions ","","Here we present a comprehensive characterization of ","the Merkel cell carcinoma genetics using a clinically implemented ","sequencing platform.
