Abstract:
Background:
c-Kit is a proto-oncogene that encodes tyrosine kinase receptor (CD117). Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a useful marker, providing information on platelet function and diameter.
Objective:
To investigate c-Kit expression and intensity in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and to investigate the relation between Ki-67 proliferation and MPV.
Methods:
A total of 32 patients, diagnosed with classic cutaneous KS, were included in this study. We reevaluated the histopathological reports with the preparations, confirmed the diagnosis and then determined the patients' histopathological stages. c-Kit expression and Ki-67 proliferation were investigated immunohistochemically in KS cases, while MPV in all cases was checked.
Results:
Although c-Kit expression was detected in 22 cases (68.8%), it was not expressed in 10 cases (31.2%). We detected 8 cases with + (25%), 6 with ++ (18.8%) and 8 with +++ (25%). Ki-67 expression was 5.0% (min-max 1.0-20.0). Relapse was observed in 5 cases (15.6%) out of 32. There was positive correlation between c-Kit expression and MPV (rs=0.598, p<0.001), and between c-Kit intensity and MPV (rs=0.588, p<0.001).
Conclusion:
c-Kit is highly positive in KS. c-Kit positivity indicates a high risk of tumor growth, invasion and relapse. Furthermore, c-Kit expression stimulates megakaryocytes to release young and large thrombocytes into the periphery. Thus, high MPV, c-Kit expression and immunostaining intensity indicate high invasion and relapse in KS subjects.

INTRODUCTION
Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a metacentric, low-grade vessel tumor of mesenchymal origin. Although it can be observed in all organs, it presents predominantly in mucocutaneous tissues.11 Radu O, Pantanowitz L. Kaposi sarcoma. Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2013;137:289-94. There are 4 types with principally classified, defined according to histopathological characteristics (new vascular proliferation, erythrocyte extravasation, edema and mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration): classic, African (endemic), iatrogenic and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related.22 Tiussi RM, Caus AL, Diniz LM, Lucas EA. Kaposi's sarcoma: clinical and pathological aspects in patients seen at the Hospital Universit√°rio Cassiano Ant√¥nio Moraes - Vit√≥ria - Esp√≠rito Santo - Brazil. An Bras Dermatol. 2012;87:220-7. In practice, KS generally presents as one or multiple, asymptomatic, red-purple or brown patches, plaques or nodular skin lesions in the lower extremities.33 Wu XJ, Pu XM, Kang XJ, Halifu Y, An CX, Zhang DZ, et al. One hundred and five Kaposi sarcoma patients: a clinical study in Xinjiang, Northwest of China. J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2014;28:1545-52. C-Kit is involved in cell signal transduction in many different cell types and it encodes tyrosine kinase receptor (CD117). Furthermore, c-Kit is a mutagenic effective proto-oncogene with a stem-cell factor (SCF) as a ligand, and it leads to tumor growth through impairment of cellular growth regulation.44 Ray P, Krishnamoorthy N, Oriss TB, Ray A. Signaling of c-Kit in dendritic cells influences adaptive immunity. Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2010;1183:104-22. In humans, it is localized in the q11-q22 region of the fourth chromosome. As a member of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family, c-Kit plays a key role in the tumorigenesis of KS.55 Cavallin LE, Goldschmidt-Clermont P, Mesri EA. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of KSHV oncogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma associated with HIV/AIDS. PLoS Pathog. 2014;10:e1004154 In the literature c-Kit expression has been investigated but different results have been reported.66 Miettinen M, Sarlomo-Rikala M, Lasota J. KIT expression in angiosarcomas and fetal endothelial cells: lack of mutations of exon 11 and exon 17 of c-Kit. Mod Pathol. 2000;13:536-41.7 Pantanowitz L, Schwartz EJ, Dezube BJ, Kohler S, Dorfman RF, Tahan SR. C-Kit (CD117) expression in AIDS-related, classic, and African endemic Kaposi sarcoma.

Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a simple, inexpensive and easily applied test. Additionally, it provides information on thrombocyte functions and diameters, and is a good indicator for thrombocytes activation.99 Cumhur Cure M, Cure E, Yuce S, Yazici T, Karakoyun I, Efe H. Mean platelet volume and vitamin D level. Ann Lab Med. 2014;34:98-103. A high MPV indicates the presence of large and active thrombocytes in the periphery. These thrombocytes express excessively PDGF, thromboxane A2, glycoprotein Ib and IIb/IIIa receptors.1010 Varol E, Ozaydin M, T√ºrker Y, Alaca S. Mean platelet volume, an indicator of platelet activation, is increased in patients with mitral stenosis and sinus rhythm. Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 2009;69:708-12 The production of these substances increases thrombosis in patients with cancer and especially, high level of PDGF may promote tumor growth and invasion in malignancies.1111 Wang Y, Qiu H, Hu W, Li S, Yu J. Over-expression of platelet-derived growth factor-D promotes tumor growth and invasion in endometrial cancer. Int J Mol Sci. 2014;15:4780-94. In the literature, MPV was reported as a prognostic factor for different cancers.1212 Inagaki N, Kibata K, Tamaki T, Shimizu T, Nomura S. Prognostic impact of the mean platelet volume/platelet count ratio in terms of survival in advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer. Lung Cancer. 2014;83:97-101.,1313 Tuncel T, Ozgun A, Emirzeoglu L, Celik S, Bilgi O, Karagoz B. Mean platelet volume as a prognostic marker in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with bevacizumab-combined chemotherapy. Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15:6421-3.

In this study, we aimed to: investigate c-Kit expression and immunostaining intensity; explore whether there is a relationship between MPV and c-Kit expression; and determine whether MPV is a predictor for relapse risk in subjects with classic KS.
METHODS
The study was compiled following the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and affirmed by the local ethics committee. A total of 32 patients (21 males, 11 females) were included in the study; they had been diagnosed with classic cutaneous KS in the pathology department between 2010 and 2014. The data obtained during recurrence in patients with relapse were only used their first data to the statistics. Histopathological reports with the preparations were reevaluated, the diagnosis was confirmed and the patients' histopathological stages were then determined. The subjects had no history of human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection, organ transplantation or immunosuppressive treatment.
Paraffin-embedded blocks of KS subjects were cut into 3 micrometer sections and put on positively charged slides for immunohistochemical study. CD117 (ready-to-use mouse monoclonal antibody, Biogenex, Fremont, CA, USA) and Ki-67 (ready-to-use mouse monoclonal antibody, Biogenex, Fremont, CA, USA) primary antibodies were applied to the sections for immunohistochemical study. The following were applied for the immunohistochemical staining system: biotin-free, HRP multimer-based, hydrogen peroxide substrate and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) chromogen containing ultraViewTM Universal DAB Detection Kit (Catalog number 760-091, Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ,USA), and a fully automated immunohistochemistry staining device (Ventana Bench Mark XT, Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA). Immunohistochemical staining included deparaffinization and antigen revealing procedures, which were carried out using Bench Mark XT fully automatic immunohistochemical staining devices. Primer antibodies CD117 and Ki-67 were only manually dripped at 37¬∞C and incubated for 30 minutes. Mayer's hematoxylin was used as a contrast stain and the sections were evaluated blindly by 2 pathologists via Olympus BX51 light microscopy. Basal keratinocytes were used as a positive control for CD117 and Ki-67. Membranous or cytoplasmic staining of the tumor cells were positive > 1% for CD117. Moreover, CD117 staining and intensity were evaluated semi-quantitatively for all the subjects. The extent of CD117 staining was accepted as -, no positive or < 1% positive cells;+, (10% of cells), ++, (>10and <50% of cells), and +++ (>50% of cells).88 Kandemir NO, Gun BD, Bahadir B, Yurdakan G, Ozdemir N, Karadayi N, et al. c-Kit (CD117) expression in classic Kaposi's sarcoma. Clin Exp Dermatol. 2010;35:525-30. CD117 intensity was scored as 0 (none), 1+ (weak), 2+ (moderate) and 3+ (strong).1414 Hussein TM, El-Sabaa BM, Hanafy NF. Evaluation of c-kit expression in classic Kaposi's sarcoma in a cohort of Egyptian patients. J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2012;24:1-6. Nuclear staining in tumor cells was considered positive for Ki-67. The hematologic parameters were studied using the Abbott Cell Dyn Ruby analyzer (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA).
The results are expressed as a median (minimum- maximum) or a percentage where appropriate. Furthermore, the entire statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS for Windows (version 17; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) program. Non-numerical data such as gender, location and histologic stage were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test (when at least 25% of the cells had expected frequencies of under 5, Fisher's exact test was used). In this study, the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test (when the number of groups had frequencies of above 2, the Kruskal-Wallis test was performed) were used to compare numerical data because of their non-normal distribution and the small number of subjects. Spearman's formula was applied for correlation analysis. A P level of <0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
The lesions were localized as follows: 20 (62.5%) on the legs, 8 (25%) on the arms and 4 (12.5%) on the head and neck (H&N). While the vast majority of cases were at the nodular stage (53.1%), 31.3% of them were at the plaque stage, and the remaining 15.6% were at the patch stage. c-Kit expression was not detected in 10 cases (31.2%), 8 (25%) cases had +, 6 (18.8%) cases had ++ and 8 (25%) cases had +++. Furthermore, c-Kit immunostaining intensity was + for 7 cases (21.9%), ++ for 7 cases (21.9%) and +++ for 8 cases (25%) (Figure 1). Ki-67 expression was 5.0% (min-max 1.0-20.0) (Figure 1). Relapse was detected in 5 (15.6%) cases out of 32; c-Kit expression levels in relapse cases comprised 2 cases with +, 1 case with ++ and 2 cases with +++. All sociodemographic data are shown in table 1.

The cases (31.2%) with negative c-Kit expression (CN) were compared with those (68.8%) involving positive c-Kit expression (CP). The MPV level of the CN group was 7.0 (6.0-10.4) fL, whereas it was 8.4 (6.3-11.2) fL (p=0.007) in the CP group. While 5 cases showed relapse in the CP group, no relapses were noted in the CN group (p=0.155). However, there was no statistical significance. Other data revealed no significance. All the results are displayed in table 2.

Ki-67 expression in the plaque group was significantly higher than in the patch group (p=0.042). The white blood cell level of the plaque group was significantly lower than in the patch group (p=0.037). Interestingly, the Ki-67 level of the plaque group was higher than in the nodular group. Nevertheless, it was not statistically significant. The MPV levels of the patch and nodular groups correlated positively with increases in the disease stage. However, no statistical significance was noted. All the results are shown in table 3. Relapse was high in cases involving leg lesions. The MPV level and Ki-67 expression of subjects with relapse were higher than in subjects without relapse, although they were not significant. All the results are shown in table 4.

Comparison of Ki-67 according to gender revealed that while it was 10.0 (3.0-20.0)% in females, it was 4.0 (1.0-20.0)% in males (p=0.013). However, c-Kit expression, MPV and other parameters entailed no gender difference.
c-Kit expression correlated positively with both MPV (rs=0.602, p<0.001) and c-Kit intensity (rs=0.991, p<0.001). There were no positive or negative correlations between c-Kit expression and the other parameters (age, rs=0.102, p=0.547; stage rs=0.155, p=0.361; ki67 rs=0.300, p=0.072; white blood cell counts rs=0.146, p=0.388; hemoglobin rs=0.124, p=0.465; platelets rs=0.199, p=0.239, respectively). Further, c-Kit intensity correlated positively with MPV (rs=0.599, p<0.001). There were no positive or negative correlations between c-Kit intensity and the other parameters (age, rs=0.116, p=0.494; stage rs=0.137, p=0.418; ki67 rs=0.296, p=0.075; white blood cell counts rs=0.173, p=0.305; hemoglobin rs=0.142, p=0.401; platelets rs=0.226, p=0.179, respectively).
DISCUSSION
As the results of our study demonstrate, c-Kit expression was observed in the vast majority of KS patients. c-Kit expression was positive in all patients with relapse. The MPV level of individuals with positive c-Kit expression was higher than in those with negative c-Kit expression. Ki-67 percentages were similar in both positive and negative groups. Whereas the Ki-67 percentage was significantly higher at the plaque stage than the patch stage, it was higher than at the nodular stage. However, it was not statistically significant. The MPV level was found to increase steadily with the stage, yet it was statistically insignificant. Ki-67 percentages and MPV levels in relapse patients were insignificantly higher than in those without relapse.
c-Kit expression in KS patients has been reported in different ranges by a limited number of studies. While Miettinen et al. reported a c-Kit expression rate of 15.3 % (13 cases) in KS, whereas Sarlomo-Rikala et al. reported no c-Kit expression in 7 cases.66 Miettinen M, Sarlomo-Rikala M, Lasota J. KIT expression in angiosarcomas and fetal endothelial cells: lack of mutations of exon 11 and exon 17 of c-Kit. Mod Pathol. 2000;13:536-41.,1515 Sarlomo-Rikala M, Kovatich AJ, Barusevicius A, Miettinen M. CD117: a sensitive marker for gastrointestinal stromal tumors that is more specific than CD34. Mod Pathol. 1998;11:728-34. However, both studies investigated a limited number of KS cases. Pantanowitz et al. also found that c-Kit expression was not linked to histopathological stage or tumor localization. However, they reported a c-Kit expression of 56% in classic KS cases.77 Pantanowitz L, Schwartz EJ, Dezube BJ, Kohler S, Dorfman RF, Tahan SR. C-Kit (CD117) expression in AIDS-related, classic, and African endemic Kaposi sarcoma. Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2005;13:162-6. Only 5 cases were investigated in the Pantanowitz et al. study. In a larger study, Kandemir et al. investigated 35 KS cases and uncovered a c-Kit expression of 62.8%. Reactivity was +1 (n=16), +2 (n=2), +3 (n=4). Additionally, they reported c-Kit immunostaining to be 60% at the patch stage, 66.6% at the plaque stage and 63% at the nodular stage. They found that both c-Kit expression and immunostaining intensity were unrelated to histopathological stage.88 Kandemir NO, Gun BD, Bahadir B, Yurdakan G, Ozdemir N, Karadayi N, et al. c-Kit (CD117) expression in classic Kaposi's sarcoma. Clin Exp Dermatol. 2010;35:525-30. In our study, out of 32 cases, c-Kit expression emerged in a range of 68.8%. In the three other studies, a low number of cases may lead to bias. However, the number of KS cases in our study is similar to the study of Kandemir et al. and both of the studies have got large population; therefore, both of the studies results' confirm each other.88 Kandemir NO, Gun BD, Bahadir B, Yurdakan G, Ozdemir N, Karadayi N, et al. c-Kit (CD117) expression in classic Kaposi's sarcoma. Clin Exp Dermatol. 2010;35:525-30. Like Pantanowitz et al., we found that c-Kit expression was not linked to histopathological stage or tumor localization.77 Pantanowitz L, Schwartz EJ, Dezube BJ, Kohler S, Dorfman RF, Tahan SR. C-Kit (CD117) expression in AIDS-related, classic, and African endemic Kaposi sarcoma. Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2005;13:162-6. Unlike the other studies, the relapse rate for KS in our study was 15.6%. Curiously, all patients with relapse had positive c-Kit expression, while cases with negative c-kit expression did not entail relapses. Nevertheless, there was no relationship between c-Kit intensity and relapse.
c-Kit is a member of the tyrosine kinase family and its positivity indicates indirectly the use of tyrosine kinase pathway in tumor growth and invasion.1616 Perumal D, Pillai S, Nguyen J, Schaal C, Coppola D, Chellappan SP. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors induce c-Kit ligand/Stem Cell Factor and promote stemness in an ARRB1/ Œ≤-arrestin-1 dependent manner in NSCLC. Oncotarget. 2014;5:10486-502.,1717 Phuchareon J, van Zante A, Overdevest JB, McCormick F, Eisele DW, Tetsu O. C-Kit Expression is Rate-Limiting for Stem Cell Factor-Mediated Disease Progression in Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma of the Salivary Glands. Transl Oncol. 2014;7:537-45. Interestingly, although it was not statistically significant, MPV levels were higher in relapse cases. Furthermore, while MPV levels were low in cases with negative c-Kit, they were remarkably high in cases with c-Kit expression. The MPV level indicates young and large thrombocytes in the periphery. These thrombocytes release many aggregator substances that lead to arterial and venous thrombosis. c-Kit expression stimulates megakaryocytes, therefore we might have found high correlation between c-Kit expression and MPV.1818 Bayraktar UD, Bayraktar S, Rocha-Lima CM. Molecular basis and management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. World J Gastroenterol. 2010;16:2726-34. Equally, PDGF is a factor released mostly from thrombocytes and it is a member of the tyrosine kinase family.1919 Andrae J, Gallini R, Betsholtz C. Role of platelet-derived growth factors in physiology and medicine. Genes Dev. 2008;22:1276-312. PDGF production contributes to both the development and invasion of the tumor.2020 Liu KW, Hu B, Cheng SY. Platelet-derived growth factor signaling in human malignancies. Chin J Cancer. 2011;30:581-4. We speculate that the presence of young and large thrombocytes in the periphery reflect indirectly the expression of both c-Kit and PDGF. This may be related to the strong association between c-Kit expression and MPV level, a finding of our study. Rossi et al. have suggested the production of PDGF plays a role in KS etiology.2121 Rossi G, Sartori G, Rusev BC, Sgambato A. Expression and molecular analysis of c-Kit and PDGFRs in Kaposi's sarcoma of different stages and epidemiological settings. Histopathology. 2009;54:619-22. In a pilot study, Koon et al. found that imatinib, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, was an effective treatment in KS cases due to its inhibition of c-Kit and PDGF expression.2222 Koon HB, Krown SE, Lee JY, Honda K, Rapisuwon S, Wang Z, et al. Phase II trial of imatinib in AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma: AIDS Malignancy Consortium Protocol 042. J Clin Oncol. 2014;32:402-8.

Thus, the elevation of MPV level may be important not only in invasion and relapse but also in following the treatment response. The expression of a nuclear protein Ki-67 increases when cells start division. It is a good marker for cellular division2323 Li N, Deng W, Ma J, Wei B, Guo K, Shen W, et al. Prognostic evaluation of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, PCNA, Ki67 and E-cadherin expression in gastric cancer. Med Oncol. 2015;32:433. and was observed in 4.5-11.5% of KS cases.2424 Pyakurel P, Massambu C, Casta√±os-V√©lez E, Ericsson S, Kaaya E, Biberfeld P, et al. Human herpesvirus 8/Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus cell association during evolution of Kaposi sarcoma. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2004;36:678-83. In our study, it was expressed in 7.3¬±5.5% out of 32 KS patients. Interestingly, while Ki-67 proliferation was highest at the plaque stage, it was lowest at the patch stage. Lower Ki-67 at the nodular stage than the plaque stage does not indicate a relationship between the histopathological stage and Ki-67 expression. Similarly, Penin et al. reported that Ki-67 proliferation bore no relationship with the histological stage.2525 Penin RM, Fernandez-Figueras MT, Puig L, Rex J, Ferrandiz C, Ariza A. Overexpression of p45 (SKP2) in Kaposi's sarcoma correlates with higher tumor stage and extracutaneous involvement but is not directly related to p27(KIP1) downregulation. Mod Pathol. 2002;15:1227-35. In this study, Ki-67 proliferation was higher in cases with relapse than in cases without relapse. However, it was not statistically significant. The percentage of Ki-67 in the cases with positive c-Kit was slightly higher than in those with negative c-Kit. But no relationship has been established between c-Kit expression and c-Kit immunostaining intensity. Compared with cases without relapse, those involving relapse entailed positive c-Kit, high MPV and high Ki-67 proliferation.
CONCLUSION
C-Kit positivity is extremely high in KS. The presence of c-Kit positivity increases the risk of tumor growth, invasion and relapse. As c-Kit is a member of the tyrosine kinase family, its expression simulates megakaryopoiesis, leading to the production of young and large thrombocytes in the periphery. Thus, a high MPV level, c-Kit expression and immunostaining intensity in KS cases may reflect invasion and relapse. Ki-67 indicates cell proliferation. According to our results, Ki-67 proliferation in KS was under 10% and it bore no relationship with the histopathological stage.

Summary
BackgroundDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare skin cancer. Standard treatment in the UK is either wide local excision (WLE) or Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). It is unclear which approach has the lower recurrence rate.ObjectivesWe undertook a retrospective comparative review of surgical management of DFSP in the UK National Health Service in order to define (i) current surgical practice for primary and recurrent DFSP, (ii) local recurrence rates for primary DFSP and (iii) survival outcomes for DFSP.MethodsA retrospective clinical case‚Äênote review of patients with histologically confirmed DFSP (January 2004 to December 2013) who have undergone surgical treatment.ResultsThe surgical management of 483 primary and 64 recurrent DFSP in 11 plastic surgery and 15 dermatology departments was analysed. Almost 75% of primary DFSP (n = 362) were treated with WLE and 20% (n = 97) with MMS. For recurrent DFSP, 69% (n = 44) and 23% (n = 15) of patients underwent WLE and MMS, respectively. Recurrent primary DFSP occurred in six patients after WLE and none after MMS. The median follow‚Äêup time was 25¬∑5 months (interquartile range 6¬∑8‚Äì45¬∑1) for new and 19¬∑8 (IQR 4¬∑5‚Äì44¬∑5) for recurrent DFSP [Correction added on 1 Feb 2021, after first online publication: 4.8 years (interquartile range 3.5‚Äê5.8) was incorrect], with eight reported deaths during the follow‚Äêup analysis period (one confirmed to be DFSP related).ConclusionsWLE was the most common surgical modality used to treat DFSP across the UK. The local recurrence rate was very low, occurring only after WLE. Although a prospective randomized controlled trial may provide more definitive outcomes, in the absence of a clearly superior surgical modality, treatment decisions should be based on patient preference, clinical expertise and cost.

Summary
BackgroundMicrocystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) is a rare skin neoplasm that has not been characterized on a molecular basis.AimTo assess expression profiles of Hedgehog (HH) signalling molecules in MAC and control tumours.MethodsImmunohistochemistry was performed for Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Indian Hedgehog (IHH), Patched 1 (PTCH1) and Smoothened (SMO) on patient MAC tissue (n¬†=¬†26) and control tumour tissue, including syringoma (SyG; n¬†=¬†11), trichoepithelioma (TE; n¬†=¬†11) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC; n¬†=¬†12) tissues.ResultsPatched 1 and SMO immunoreactivity was significantly higher in BCC than in SyG, TE or MAC (P¬†<¬†0.001 and P¬†<¬†0.03, respectively). The highest IHH expression was observed in BCC and TE compared with SyG and MAC (P¬†<¬†0.04). Notably, the highest SHH protein expression was observed in SyG compared with MAC, TE and even BCC (P¬†<¬†0.001). In patients with MAC, SMO immunoreactivity significantly (r¬†=¬†0.51; P¬†<¬†0.01) correlated with PTCH1 expression. Further correlation studies did not show significant associations between the HH expression markers assessed (P¬†>¬†0.05).ConclusionOur results indicate that alterations of the HH signalling are unlikely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of MAC, which is in contrast to the morphologically similar BCC and TE. Our observation provides additional information to the limited molecular pathology knowledge on this rare tumour. 
Introduction
Microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) is an infrequent skin tumour that commonly occurs on the face of elderly white patients. Clinically and histopathologically, MAC may mimic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and the benign neoplasms syringoma (SyG) and trichoepithelioma (TE). Diagnosis of MAC may be challenging as superficial biopsies often reveal only benign findings such as SyG. MAC is locally aggressive and rarely metastasizes. Patients are treated with surgery, which may need to be followed by radiation in a small subset. Patients with MAC have an excellent 10‚Äêyear overall survival rate of 86%. Poorly differentiated/anaplastic MAC is associated with more aggressive disease compared with well‚Äêdifferentiated tumours. The pathogenesis of MAC is based on pilar and eccrine differentiation.1‚Äì4 To date, however, there are only limited data on the oncogenic pathways driving MAC.The Hedgehog (HH) signalling cascade is one of the main developmental pathways in human embryogenesis and organogenesis. It is well known that reactivation of the HH pathway later in life can lead to the development of cancers.5, 6 In mammals, three HH homologs have been identified: Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Indian Hedgehog (IHH) and Desert Hedgehog. HH proteins bind to their receptor Patched (PTCH) to interfere with its inhibiting function for Smoothened (SMO).5, 6 It is well known that both BCC and TE are associated with pathological alterations in the HH signalling pathway.5, 7, 8 As both tumour types are phenotypically similar to MAC we hypothesized that the HH pathway might also be altered in MAC.1‚Äì8 We performed a study to determine the protein expression profiles of HH signalling molecules in MACs. Methods
The study was approved by the local ethics review board (#4749‚Äì13). Informed consent for use of tissue had been obtained on a routine basis from patients. Tissues
Archived formalin‚Äêfixed paraffin wax‚Äêembedded (FFPE) MAC tissues were collected in three dermatology centres in Germany (Bochum, Duisburg, Hornheide). Diagnosis of all tumours was confirmed by at least two of three senior dermatohistopathologists (MS, JS, HJS). As controls, we included SyG, TE and BCC tissues. Immunohistochemistry of tumour samples
Staining for SHH, IHH, PTCH1 and SMO was performed as follows: 4‚Äê¬µm sections from FFPE blocks were mounted onto microscope slides (Dako IHC Microscope Slides; Dako, Hamburg, Germany) and stored for 30¬†min in a humid chamber at 80¬†¬∞C. Sections were dewaxed and heated in a target retrieval solution (EnVision FLEX; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at either low pH (SHH, IHH) or high pH (SMO, PTCH) for 20¬†min. Blocking of nonspecific staining was accomplished with a commercial blocking agent (Dual Endogenous Enzyme Block S2003; Dako) for 5¬†min. For immunostaining, we used rabbit monoclonal antibodies against SHH (cat. no. ab53281), IHH (ab52919), SMO (ab72130) and PTCH1 (ab53715) (all Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA). The diluted antibodies were incubated at room temperature for either 30¬†min (SMO 1¬†:¬†500 and PTCH1 1¬†:¬†200) or 90¬†min (SHH 1¬†:¬†150 and IHH 1¬†:¬†250). The following steps of the immunohistochemistry procedures were performed in accordance with the manufacturer‚Äôs recommendations for the system (Dako REAL Detection System K5005; Dako). Visualization of the antigens was achieved by a commercial stain (AP/Permanent Red; Abcam) with haematoxylin for counterstaining. Microscopic evaluation
For microscopic analysis, stained slides were scanned at √ó¬†20 magnification (Nanozoomer Whole Slide Scanner; Hamamatsu Photonics, Herrsching am Ammersee, Germany) and the images were evaluated using the viewer software (NDP.view2; Hamamatsu Photonics). All stained slides were separately evaluated by the same two independent observers (IH, TG). Microscopic evaluation was performed within the tumour tissues in five randomly chosen fields of view. PTCH1 stains were evaluated only for membranous and cytosolic immunoreactivity; the antibody‚Äêspecific nuclear staining was not considered. The percentage of positively stained tumour cells per field out of the total tumour cell count per field was determined and multiplied by an intensity score (0¬†=¬†none, 1¬†=¬†slight, 2¬†=¬†moderate, 3¬†=¬†strong staining) resulting in a total score range of 0‚Äì300 (H‚Äêscore). Quantitative results were expressed as averaged score and range values per lesion. Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using the statistical package MedCalc (V19.8; MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). Distribution of data was assessed by the D'Agostino‚ÄìPearson test. Normally distributed data were expressed as mean¬†¬±¬†SD, and non‚Äênormally distributed data as median (range). Where appropriate, data were analysed using Kruskal‚ÄìWallis ANOVA (with Conover post hoc testing), Spearman correlation coefficient and œá2‚Äêtest. P¬†<¬†0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results
Patients
We collected tissues from 26 patients with MAC (11 men, 15 women; median age 75¬†years, range 35‚Äì90). As controls, we included tissues from 11 women with SyG (median age 73¬†years, range 65‚Äì80), 11 women with TE (median age: 62¬†years, range 43‚Äì88) and 12 patients with BCC (6 men, 6 women; median age: 74.5¬†years, range 46‚Äì90). Hence, the sex distribution of patients with MAC or BCC differed significantly (P¬†<¬†0.05) from those with SyG or TE. Tumours
Almost all tumours were located on the head/face (P¬†>¬†0.05) (Table¬†1). Immunoreactivity was predominantly observed in the cytosol and/or cell membrane of tumour cells (Fig.¬†1). As summarized in Table¬†1, PTCH1 and SMO immunoreactivities were significantly higher (P¬†<¬†0.001 and P¬†<¬†0.03, respectively) in BCC tissues than in SyG, TE or MAC tissues. The highest IHH expression was observed in BCC and TE compared with SyG and MAC (P¬†<¬†0.04). Notably, SHH protein expression was significantly higher in SyG than in MAC, TE and even BCC (P¬†=¬†0.00075). In patients with MAC, immunoreactivity of SMO and PTCH1 were significantly correlated (r¬†=¬†0.51; P¬†<¬†0.01). Immunoreactivity of PTCH1 (P¬†=¬†0.44), IHH (P¬†=¬†0.43), SSH (P¬†=¬†0.69) and SMO (P¬†=¬†0.66) was not significantly different between normal epidermis and MAC tissue (Fig.¬†2). Further correlation studies did not show significant associations between the HH expression markers assessed (P¬†>¬†0.05).

Figure 1Immunostaining for various Hedgehog signalling molecules [Patched (PTCH)1, Smoothened (SMO), Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Indian Hedgehog (IHH)]. PTCH1 and SMO immunoreactivities were significantly higher in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) than in syringoma (SyG), trichoepithelioma (TE) and microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC). The highest SMO expression was observed in BCC and TE compared with SyG and MAC, while the highest SHH protein expression was observed in SyG.Open in new tabDownload slide

Owing to the rarity of MACs, the molecular characteristics remain almost undefined to date. Wohlfahrt et¬†al.9 previously performed cytogenetic analysis of a MAC and found a clonal 6q deletion as the sole karyotypic change in this tumour. The authors suggested that this observation, together with the histopathological similarities between sweat gland tumours, such as MACs and salivary gland tumours, emphasize the histogenetic relationships between these tumour types. Moreover, Chen and Laber 10 reported the first case of metastatic MAC; in this case, DNA sequencing indicated a p53 mutation and chromosomal losses in the CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes. The largest molecular profiling study on MACs was recently reported by Chan et¬†al.,11 who characterized 18 MACs by next‚Äêgeneration sequencing of the coding sequence of >¬†400 cancer‚Äêrelevant genes, and proposed that MACs are molecularly heterogeneous tumours, with inactivated p53 or activated Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signalling in a subset.11 However, unlike most other ultraviolet (UV) radiation‚Äêrelated non‚Äêmelanoma skin cancers, most MACs lack evidence of UV damage and hence more probably originate from a UV‚Äêprotected progenitor cell population in the dermis. Smith et¬†al.12 observed only sparse p53 protein expression in MACs, although MACs arise very frequently in chronically UV‚Äêexposed skin sites.12Based on morphological similarities to BCC and TE, we hypothesized that MACs may also be driven by alterations in HH signalling pathway. However, our data clearly demonstrate that the protein expression of the HH signalling pathway molecules is not significantly altered in MACs, particularly compared with BCC. This observation is in line with the aforementioned MAC data of Chan et¬†al.,11 who did not find gene mutations in the HH pathway. An interesting observation in our study was the significant positive correlation of PTCH1 and SMO protein expression in MACs. Similarly, Cavicchioli Buim et¬†al.13 investigated the mRNA expression of SHH, SMO, PTCH1 and GLI1 in 30 oral squamous cell carcinomas by quantitative real‚Äêtime PCR, and revealed strong correlation between PTCH1 and SMO expression. PTCH1 functions as a negative regulator of the HH signalling pathway by repressing downstream signalling from SMO. As a direct target of the GLI transcription factors, high levels of PTCH1 are linked to elevated HH pathway activation, where PTCH1 functions in a negative feedback loop to attenuate HH signalling. Another interesting observation in our study, which seems have been unreported to date, was the significantly increased SHH expression in SyG compared with BCC, MAC and TE. However, the increase in SHH was not associated with overexpression of the other HH molecules such as PTCH1 and SMO. Conclusion
Our results indicate that alterations of HH signalling are not likely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of MACs. Our observation increases the still limited molecular pathology knowledge of this rare tumour.14, 15 Acknowledgement
This work is part of the doctoral thesis of I. Hartenstein.What's already known about this topic?The oncogenic pathways driving MAC development have not been investigated to date.What does this study add?We demonstrate that alterations of the HH signalling pathway do not seem to play a major role in the pathogenesis of MAC, which is in contrast to morphologically similar tumours such as BCC.

Summary
BackgroundDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare and marginal cutaneous sarcoma of intermediate‚Äêgrade malignancy, for which the genomic landscape remains unclear. Understanding the landscape of DFSP will help to further classify the genomic pathway of malignant development in soft tissue.ObjectivesTo identify the comprehensive molecular pathogenesis of DFSP.MethodsIn this study, the comprehensive genomic features, with 53 tumour‚Äênormal pairs of DFSP, were revealed by whole‚Äêgenome sequencing.ResultsThe mutational signature 1 (C > T mutation at CpG dinucleotides) is featured in DFSP, resulting in higher mutations in DNA replication. Interestingly, the recurrence of DFSP is correlated with low tumour mutation burden. Novel mutation genes in DFSP were identified, including MUC4/6, KMT2C and BRCA1, and subsequently, three molecular subtypes of DFSP were classified on the basis of MUC4 and MUC6 mutations. Various structural aberrations including genomic rearrangements were identified in DSFPs, particularly in 17q and 22q, which cause oncogene amplification (AKT1, SPHK1, COL1A1, PDGFŒ≤) or tumour suppressor deletion (CDKN2A/B). In addition to gene fusion of COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ [t(17;22)], we identified gene fusion of SLC2A5‚ÄêBTBD7 [t(1;14)] in DFSP through whole‚Äêgenome sequencing, and verified it experimentally. Enrichment analysis of altered molecules revealed that DNA repair, cell cycle, phosphoinositide 3‚Äêkinase and Janus kinase pathways were primarily involved in DFSP.ConclusionsThis is the first large‚Äêscale whole‚Äêgenome sequencing for DFSP, and our findings describe the comprehensive genomic landscape, highlighting the molecular complexity and genomic aberrations of DFSP. Our findings also provide novel potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for this disease.What is already known about this topic? ¬†Chromosomal translocation between chromosome 17 and chromosome 22 is the main feature in the pathogenesis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP).What does this study add? ¬†We describe the comprehensive genomic landscape of DFSP, highlighting the molecular complexity and genomic aberrations.Our findings provide novel potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for this disease.What is the translational message? ¬†Our study revealed novel molecular subtypes of DFSP based on genetic mutations, which benefits precision diagnosis.We also found oncogene amplification, including AKT1 and SPHK1, which provides novel potential target molecules for further DFSP treatment.In addition to gene fusion of COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤, we identified a novel gene fusion of SLC2A5‚ÄêBTBD7 in DFSP, which is a novel potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for this disease. 
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a type of cutaneous soft tissue sarcoma, which is a rare malignant tumour with an incidence of approximately four per million.1 In studies of the pathogenesis of DFSP, the whole spectrum of genomic characteristics is lacking. To date, studies have revealed that chromosomal translocation between chromosome 17 and chromosome 22 is the main feature in the pathogenesis of DFSP.2‚Äì4 The second exon of platelet‚Äêderived growth factor‚ÄêŒ≤ (PDGFŒ≤) on chromosome 22 was fused to the collagen 1 Œ±1 (COL1A1) gene on chromosome 17, while various breakpoints of COL1A1 from exon 6 to 49 have been observed.2, 5, 6 ¬†PDGFŒ≤ is documented with the cellular homologue of the v‚Äêsis oncogene, which is involved in pathogenesis of diverse tumours including sarcoma.7 Evidence shows that repressor elements in PDGFŒ≤ exon 1 negatively regulate its expression. Therefore, t(17;22) results in replacement of PDGFŒ≤ exon 1 by COL1A1 elements; thus, a COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion oncogene leads to distinctly upregulated PDGFŒ≤ transcription. In addition to COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion, other fusion events were observed in DFSP, such as t(2;17), t(17;22), t(9;22) and t(5;8).8‚Äì11In this study, 53 biopsy specimens from patients with DFSP and their paired blood samples were used for whole‚Äêgenome sequencing (WGS), in which we identified a number of novel mutant genes, such as MUC4/6 and KMT2C, and several significant segments, such as 17q25, 22q13. We also identified various structural alterations of tumour‚Äêrelated genes such as SPHK1 and BRCA1, and the fusion gene SLC2A5‚ÄêBTBD7. Overall, our findings highlight novel mechanisms of DFSP pathogenesis, particularly structural alterations, which help to identify potential diagnostic and therapeutic molecules. Materials and methods
Patient characteristics and sample collection
All samples were mainly collected from the Department of Dermatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat‚Äêsen University, and the sampling procedure was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat‚Äêsen University. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Detailed information for the participants is presented in Table S1a (see Supporting Information).Biopsies were performed on patients with clinical suspicion of DFSP, and the diagnoses were made by three different pathologists. Haematoxylin and eosin staining and CD34 immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed for each tumour and all samples were positive for CD34 (Table S1b; see Supporting Information). Furthermore, IHC for additional markers such as S100, smooth muscle actin, desmin and vimentin was performed for differential diagnostic purposes (Table S1b). Patients were considered eligible if they had a diagnosis of primary DFSP and had not received chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment before the operation. Whole‚Äêgenome sequencing
All samples were processed for whole‚Äêgenome paired‚Äêend sequencing using Illumina HiSeq X10 Instruments (Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China). The sequencing data were applied to analyse single‚Äênucleotide variants (SNVs), copy‚Äênumber variants, structural variants and fusion genes. Full details are provided in Appendix S1 (see Supporting Information). Validation of amplification genes by polymerase chain reaction
Copy numbers of candidate genes were quantified for further validation in an ABI 7500 real‚Äêtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). A total of 20 ŒºL reaction volume was used with 20 ng of DNA from each sample, 2*SYBR Green Mix and primers (10 Œºmol‚àí1). Each DNA sample was analysed using quantitative PCR in triplicate. The relative copy number of candidate genes was calculated by dividing the number of candidate gene copies by the number of albumin gene copies. The following primers were used in this study: SPHK1 (F: CAGGGAATGACGCCGGTG; R: TCCTTATCGGTGCTGCCCAG) and ITGB4 (F: GGGACGAGGATGACGACTGC; R: CACCAGGACAGTGCTGTTGG). Immunohistochemistry
Tissue samples from patients who were diagnosed with DFSP were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Slides with 4‚ÄêŒºm sections were baked at 65¬∞C for 2 h and then rehydrated with ethanol (gradient concentration); 3% hydrogen peroxide was used to inhibit the endogenous peroxidase for 10 min after antigen retrieval. Tissues were then incubated with primary antibody SPHK1 (1 : 200) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and P‚Äêstat3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 1 : 200) overnight at 4¬∞C. Slides that were well incubated with primary antibody were taken out from the refrigerator and incubated with horseradish peroxidase‚Äêconjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, slides stained with DAB were counterstained with haematoxylin and mounted with neutral balsam. Fluorescence in situ hybridization test of COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion gene in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans tissues
All samples from patients were subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using the COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion gene t(17; 22) probe (Anbiping, Guangzhou, China). The fluorescent signal was observed using Olympus BX51 Microscopes (original magnification √ó 1000) (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and at least 200 cells were counted for each sample. Samples where at least 10% of tumour cells exhibited fusion signalling were considered to be positive samples. Validation of SLC2A5‚ÄêBTBD7 fusion gene by Sanger sequencing
DNA was extracted from the biopsy tissues of several patients (T27, T29, T32, T36, T28, T37) using QIAamp DNA MiNi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The target gene was fused by the BTBD7 gene on chromosome 14 to SLC2A5 on chromosome 1. The forward primer in exon 2 of SLC2A5, and the reverse primer in exon 7 of BTBD7 were designed according to the sequence before and after the breakpoint identified by WGS (F: GGATTTCCCTATGTTGC; R: TGAAAGTCCACTCTTGAC). PCR amplification using KOD FX DNA polymerase (Toyobo Inc., Tokyo, Japan) consisted of an initial cycle at 94¬∞C for 10 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94¬∞C for 30 s, annealing at 60¬∞C for 30 s, and extension at 72¬∞C for 30 s. The final extension was performed at 72¬∞C for 10 min. The amplification products were analysed by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gels and sequenced by Sangon Biotech (Sangon, Shanghai, China). Subsequently, the sequences were applied to the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for the corresponding gene on the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. Results
Genomic somatic alterations in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans
In this study, we performed WGS of the paired tumour‚Äêblood samples collected from 53 eligible patients, whose histopathology consisted of 46 ordinary samples and seven fibrosarcomatous variant types. At subsequent follow‚Äêup, five of these patients had experienced relapse, two of whom had a fibrosarcomatous variant type (Table S1a).Here, a total of 1255 somatic variants were detected, ranging from two to 84 variants per sample, with a median of 20 variations, including SNVs and small insertions and deletions (Figure S1d, Table S2a; see Supporting Information). SNVs accounted for 96% of somatic mutations, ranging from two to 78 variants per sample, with a median of 18. The six different SNV classes (T > G, T > C, T > A, C > T, C > G, C > A) were counted separately (Figure S1c), and the proportion of different SNV classes was calculated separately in all samples and in each sample, showing the two major SNV classes to be C > T and T > G, which accounted for 27% and 23% in all mutation positions, respectively (Figure S2a, c, Table S2b; see Supporting Information). As the nucleotide substitutions provide insight into the mutational processes that shaped the cancer genome, the mutational signatures were analysed further and signature 1 was shown to be a pivotal mutation type in DFSP, followed by signatures 3, 6 and 15 (Figure 1a, Table S2c). Signature 1, characterized by C > T mutation at NpCpG trinucleotides, is the result of an endogenous mutational process initiated by spontaneous deamination of 5‚Äêmethylcytosine.

[Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]Open in new tabDownload slideCompared with the 33 solid tumours in the The Cancer Genome Atlas database, the number of mutations per sample in DFSP was relatively low and similar to that found in the SARC tumour (Figure S3; see Supporting Information). Furthermore, the tumour mutation burden (TMB) of DFSP samples was separately evaluated, ranging from 0.58 to 9.42 mutations per megabase, with a median of 3.43 mutations per megabase sequenced [Figure 1b (top panel), Table S2d]. Interestingly, a significantly lower TMB was found in the samples from patients who had relapsed (Figure 1c), while no significant difference in TMB was found between fibrosarcomatous variants and ordinary samples, suggesting that a low TMB in DFSP may be associated with immune escape and not with pathological type.In addition, 958 somatic mutant genes were detected in the DFSP cohort (Table S2e); 47 genes with mutations in at least three samples were detected (> 5%), which were subjected to further analysis. In particular, MUC6 and MUC4 showed high mutational frequency, accounting for 25% and 21% of patients, respectively. Subsequently, six genes were found to have been included in oncoKB,12 an evidence‚Äêbased oncology knowledge base pertaining to somatic mutations and structural alterations, such as KMT2C (15%), PDE4DIP (8%), PRSS1 (8%), HLA‚ÄêA (8%), HLA‚ÄêB (6%) and BRCA1 (6%). Through positional clustering of variants using the oncodriveCLUST algorithm,13 11 genes with mutational frequency greater than 5% were identified as driver genes (Table S2f). Taken together, as shown in Figure 1b (bottom panel), these findings lead us to speculate that these mutational genes may be related to DFSP tumorigenesis. Among these genes, we observed a significant mutual exclusion between MUC4 and MUC6, and a significant cooccurrence between PRSS1 and HLA‚ÄêB (Figure S4; see Supporting Information). Interestingly, when MUC4 and MUC6 were taken as molecular characteristics of DFSP sample typing, our findings showed that mutation of MUC4 is associated with a high TMB compared with mutation of MUC6 and nonmutation of MUC4 and MUC6 (Figure 1d). Several recent studies showed that MUC4, MUC16 and the TTN gene mutations correlate with prognosis and predicted TMB and immunotherapy efficacy in gastric cancer and pan‚Äêcancer cohorts.14‚Äì16 However, we did not detect MUC4, MUC16 and TTN mutation in the five patients who relapsed, suggesting that mutations in these genes may be used as biomarkers of relapse in DFSP. Furthermore, MUC6 mutation is closely related to the patients‚Äô age (Figure 1e). Given the significant cooccurence of PRSS1 and HLA‚ÄêB, we found that mutation of PRSS1 plus HLA‚ÄêB is remarkably relevant to tumour size (Figure 1f). Additionally, genes with mutational frequency greater than 5% were taken to perform gene ontology (GO) enrichment on biological process (BP), molecular function (MF) and cell component (CC) (Figure S5a‚Äìb, Table S3a‚Äìc; See Supporting Information), showing that these genes (MUC4, MUC6 and MUC16) were mainly involved in immune response and protein glycosylation. Copy‚Äênumber variation landscape and recurrently amplified genes in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans
Genome‚Äêwide copy‚Äênumber variations (CNVs) of sequence segments in each paired sample were separately evaluated using Sequenza (https://cran.r‚Äêproject.org),17 and 27 significant segments were identified in the cohort by GISTIC2.0 (https://www.genepattern.org),18 including 16 amplification peaks (APs) and 11 deletion peaks (DPs) (Figure S6a, Table S4a; see Supporting Information). Subsequently, the genes mapping to the significant CNV segments in each tumour sample were summarized, with the number of CNV genes ranging from one to 2416, with a median of 1630 and a median of 1435 amplification genes and five deletion genes (Figure S6a, top panel).As shown in Figure 2a, the raw copy number revealed a large amount of amplified CNV in DFSP, especially in chromosomes 17 and 22. Meanwhile, the amplified segments of 17q25, 22q13 and 22q11 were detected in 81%, 79% and 75% of the samples in the cohort, respectively (Figure S6a, bottom panel). Significant genes located in APs and DPs were also identified (Table S4b, c). In particular, as shown in Figure 2b, we discovered that several identified amplified segments cover some well‚Äêknown oncodriver genes, such as TERT (5p15.22), AKT1 (14q11.2), NFKBIA (14q11.2), BTBD7 (14q11.2), SPHK1 (17q25.1), ITGB4 (17q25.1) COL1A1 (17q25.1) and PDGFŒ≤ (22q13.1), and that the deletion segment covers tumour suppressor genes, including CDKN2A (9p21.3) and CDKN2B (9p21.3). These findings suggest that the CNVs of these fragments may be associated with DFSP tumorigenesis. We further found that the amplified 17q25 was positively related to tumour size, Ki67 expression and duration (Figure 2c), and that amplified 5p15, 4p11, 15q11 and 16p11 were also relevant to Ki67 expression in DFSP (Figure S6b). The identified amplified genes in DFSP were subjected to GO enrichment analysis, and the results showed that they are mainly involved in skin epidermal cell differentiation, mitotic cell cycle phase transition, and epidermal growth factor (Figure S7, Table S5a‚Äìc; see Supporting Information). However, no significant BP, MF or CC with Benjamini‚ÄìHochberg (BH)‚Äêadjusted P‚Äêvalue cutoff of 0.05 was found based on the genes mapped by significant deletion segments.

(d) Verification and comparison of copy number of genes SPHK1 and ITGB4 between 17q25‚Äêamplification (positive) and wildtype samples (negative). Copy‚Äênumber variation of genes SPHK1 and ITGB4 was explored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which was performed three times for each DNA sample. Significance was evaluated using two‚Äêtailed Mann‚ÄìWhitney U‚Äêtest (***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001). (e, f) Immunohistochemistry staining of SPHK1 (1 : 200) and p‚ÄêSTAT3 (1 : 200) in SPHK1‚Äêamplification (positive) and wildtype samples (negative) DFSP tissues as described in the Materials and methods section.

[Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]Open in new tabDownload slideMoreover, copy‚Äênumber alterations of SPHK1 and ITGB4 located in 17q25 were validated by quantitative PCR, which confirmed the amplification of 17q25 identified by WGS in DFSP (Figure 2d). Stat3 is a downstream molecule of the SPHK1 regulation signalling pathway, and p‚ÄêStat3 was significantly increased and correlated with the amplification of SPHK1 in DFSP samples (Figure 2e). These results were further verified through IHC experiments (Figure 2e). Structure variants identified in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans
Compared with whole‚Äêexome sequencing or array‚Äêbased comparative genomic hybridization, WGS is able to comprehensively reveal large‚Äêscale structural rearrangements. Here, eight structure variant (SV) subtypes were obtained in the 52 DFSP samples, i.e. deletion, inversion, tandem duplication, amplified inversion, foldback inversion, unbalanced inversion, intrachromosomal or interchromosomal translocation; the gene list corresponding to each SV is presented in Table S6. The number of SVs ranged from nine to 1301, with a median of 312.5 (Figure 3a, top panel). Among those SV subtypes, inversion, intrachromosmal and interchromosal translocation accounted for the majority, and were dominant in 23%, 20% and 45%, respectively (Figure 3a, top panel). SVs are known to regulate oncogenes or tumour suppressor gene expression, which directly contributes to carcinogenesis,19, 20 as shown in Figure 3a (bottom panel). We also found a number of key genes in the signal transduction pathways that present SVs, including genes that were observed to be significantly altered in our previous analyses, such as KMT2C, BRCA1, SPHK1, CDKN2A/B, COL1A1 and PDGFŒ≤.

[Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]Open in new tabDownload slideIn addition, clustering of breakpoint was applied to show complex genomic rearrangements in DFSP, and chromosomes 17 and 22 were found to have higher variation rates, which was consistent with the previous CNV analysis (Figure 3b). Notably, we evaluated clinical features significantly related to chromosomes 17 and 22 (Figure 3c, d) and found that the tumour size of the samples with chromosome 17 and 22 abnormalities was significantly larger than that of samples without variations. These findings indicate that DFSP is characterized by an abnormal genomic profile, particularly in chromosomes 17 and 22, which may play a key role in the tumorigenesis of DFSP. Fusion genes identified in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans
Previous studies proved that the fusion of COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ [t(17;22)] is one of the remarkable features in DFSP. Therefore, FISH analysis was applied to 43 samples, showing that the rate of COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion reached 74% (Figure 4a, top panel). Images of samples are presented in Figure S8 (see Supporting Information) and a representative sample is presented in Figure 4b. In addition, based on the WGS files, BreakID was also applied to identify fusion events and the result showed that the fusion frequency of COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ was 72% in 43 samples. Compared with the FISH analysis results for those samples, the prediction coincidence rate reached 84% (Figure 4a, Table S7b; see Supporting Information). Interestingly, we discovered that the breakpoint of PDGFŒ≤ stably occurred between exon 1 and exon 2 of transcript variant 1 (NM_002608) or transcript variant 2 (NM_033016), while COL1A1 randomly broke between exon 5 and exon 48 of transcript (NM_000088) (Table S7a). The COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion in the WGS binary alignment and map (BAM) files of DFSP samples were further confirmed through the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (Figure S9a; see Supporting Information). As expected, those samples with COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion presented significantly higher Ki67 expression (Figure 4c).

The sequences before and after the fusion breakpoint were first amplified using PCR, and the PCR products were analysed by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gels. The sequences were applied to the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for the corresponding gene on the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]Open in new tabDownload slideMoreover, as shown in Figure 4a (bottom panel), some fusion events were also detected by BreakID (Table S7b and Table S8; see Supporting Information). In particular, the frequency of SLC2A5‚ÄêBTBD7 [t(1;14)] exceeded 42%. Similarly, we discovered that the breakpoint of SLC2A5 stably occurred between exon 1 and exon 2 of transcript variant 2 (NM_001135585), while BTBD7 alternatively occurred at exon 7 of transcript variant 3 (NM_001289133) or between exon 7 and exon 8 of transcript variant 3 (NM_001289133) (Table S7a). Furthermore, the SLC2A5‚ÄêBTBD7 fusion in the WGS BAM files of DFSP samples was further confirmed through IGV (Figure S9b). We then performed PCR to verify the sequence before and after the fusion breakpoint. The sequence around the breakpoint in the fusion variant is shown in Figure 4d, demonstrating that the fusion occurred. Discussion
In this study, the landscape of genomic alterations for each DFSP revealed by WGS was summarized separately (Figure S10; see Supporting Information). Primarily, a high frequency of C > T and T > G mutations and a low TMB were detected in DFSP (Figure S1 and Figure S3). Mutational signature 1 is a major mutation type in DFSP, which is characterized by C > T mutations at CpG dinucleotides caused by deaminated 5 mC at CpG sites that have not been repaired before DNA replication, resulting in higher mutations in replication rounds.21, 22 Therefore, signature 1, which is described as a ‚Äòclock‚Äêlike‚Äô signature, is believed to be induced with mutation accumulation during DNA replication.23 Moreover, mutational signature 6 was also observed in DFSP, featuring a C > T transition at NpCpG mutation sites. BRCA1 is well known to play an essential role in DNA damage repair, and loss of function of BRCA1 triggers nonhomologous end‚Äêjoining, resulting in microhomology‚Äêmediated double‚Äêstrand break repair.24‚Äì26 DNA repair is an important signalling pathway in DFSP (Figure 5), in which BRCA1 is a key node with high frequency of SV (37%), amplification (81%) and mutation (6%), suggesting that cellular abnormalities in the DNA repair process play essential roles in the pathogenesis of DFSP. 
Figure 5Summary of genomic alterations of several key signal transduction pathways in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DNA repair, cell cycle, mitogen‚Äêactivated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3‚Äêkinase (PI3K)‚ÄêAKT and Janus kinase (JAK)‚Äêsignal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways were found to be pivotal pathways in DFSP tumorigenesis.SNV, single‚Äênucleotide variants; SV, structure variants; AMP, amplification; DEL, deletion. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]Open in new tabDownload slideTMB constitutes a quantitative analysis for measuring the number of somatic mutations per megabase in tumour cells, and the average TMB in different tumours is highly variable, ranging from about 0.5 to 12.27, 28 Comparatively, DFSP presented a relatively low TMB with a median of 3.49 (Figure S3). A higher TMB is reported to be a good prognostic marker, especially for immune checkpoint inhibitor outcomes,29, 30 and our finding showed that the TMB in patients with recurrent DFSP was significantly lower than that in those with nonrecurrent DFSP (Figure 1c), indicating that a low TMB might be a potential predictive marker for relapse of DFSP.MUC family genes, including MUC6 (25%) and MUC4 (21%), were significantly associated with mutations in DFSP. Interestingly, mutations of MUC6 and MUC4 were mutually exclusive (Figure S4), thus DFSP was classified into three subtypes based on mutation profiles (Figure 1b, bottom panel). Furthermore, KMT2C (15%), HERC2 (11%), PRSS1 (8%) and BRCA1 (6%) were identified to be related to tumorigenesis of DFSP (Figure 1b). KMT2C (known as MLL3) is a tumour suppressor gene characterized by histone methyltransferase activity to maintain H3K4 monomethylation at enhancers,31‚Äì33 and is one of the most frequently mutated genes in various tumours,33‚Äì35 and the loss of KMT2C facilitates cellular transformation.36, 37Our findings showed that several genomic rearrangement events occur in various chromosomal regions, particularly in 17q25 and 22q13, which causes amplification of oncogenes including AKT1, SPHK1, COL1A1 and PDGFŒ≤. Therefore, as a consequence of genomic variation events benefiting tumour cells, proliferation advantage may play an important role for driving DFSP. We also noticed the complexity and diversity of the SVs in DFSP, which are involved in well‚Äêknown tumour suppressor or oncogene genes, such as CDKN2A/B, BRCA1, SPHK1 and COL1A1, indicating that suppression of those pathways might be a novel potential strategy for DFSP treatment.Given the high frequency of COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion in DFSP, COL1A1 and PDGFŒ≤ were considered to be oncogenic drivers in DFSP. Our findings revealed that these two genes also exhibited high frequency of amplification and SVs, indicating that the variation of genome structure is the main cause of the abnormality of these two genes. In this study, the rate of COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion is 74%, which is lower than the rate found in previous studies.6, 38‚Äì41 Therefore, we considered that there could be two possible explanations; one relating to the patients‚Äô ethnicity, and another related to age. We compared our findings with different DFSP studies on the relationship between patients with COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion and age, as shown in Figure S11a (see Supporting Information). It appeared that old age was positively correlated with the rate of positive COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion. Furthermore, our findings also demonstrated that disease duration with confirmed COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion was significantly longer than for patients who were negative for COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion (Figure S11b), indicating that COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion could be related to the course of disease.In addition to the COL1A1‚ÄêPDGFŒ≤ fusion gene, we identified another high‚Äêfrequency fusion gene in DFSP, namely SLC2A5‚ÄêBTBD7 (Figure 4), which has been reported to be a fusion gene in prostate cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.42, 43 ¬†SLC2A5 encodes Glut5, which is one of the facilitative glucose transporters that responds to fructose transport.44‚Äì46 Evidence showed that inhibition of Glut5 expression significantly attenuates a malignant phenotype in breast cancer cells and Glut5 may act as a novel biomarker for early tumour diagnosis.47, 48 ¬†BTBD7 belongs to the POZ gene family, which is characterized by the BTB/POZ protein‚Äìprotein interaction motif.49 ¬†BTBD7 plays a critical role in tumour cell epithelial mesenchymal transition through Snail2, fibronectin and E‚Äêcadherin in lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma;50, 51 however, the function of SLC2A5‚ÄêBTBD7 fusion remains to be further clarified.This is the first study to describe comprehensive genomic alterations in DFSP. Through WGS, we identified gene mutations, CNVs and fusion gene profiles in DFSP. DNA repair, cell cycle, mitogen‚Äêactivated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3‚Äêkinase‚ÄêAKT and Janus kinase‚Äêsignal transducer and activator of transcription pathways are pivotal pathways involving the altered genes, which may shed light on the identification of potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in DFSP.

        Abstract



Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a soft tissue tumor that arises from the dermis. This relatively rare, low-grade tumor has a high propensity for local recurrence unless it is completely excised. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans classically progresses slowly as a plaque on the trunk of young adults. It often resembles a scar that is slowly growing over months to years. Because of its rarity and subtle progression, this form of skin cancer will often go undiagnosed for years. Over time, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans can become invasive into the subcutaneous fat, muscle, fascia, and chest wall. Diagnosis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is made by a core needle or incisional biopsy. Once diagnosed, cure rates approach 100%. The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, differential diagnosis, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Increasing healthcare providers' awareness about this rare form of skin cancer and its recognition may improve patient outcomes.


BACKGROUND
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a skin tumor that involves cutaneous soft tissues. This relatively rare tumor typically presents as a slowly progressive plaque on the trunk of young adults. DFSP has an expansive differential diagnosis (Table 1). It typically resembles a scar that slowly grows for months to years. This low-grade tumor has a high likelihood of local recurrence unless it is completely excised. Because of its rarity and subtle progression, this skin cancer will often go undiagnosed for years (Tanwar et al., 2021). Over time, DFSP can become invasive into the subcutaneous fat, muscle, and fascia. Studies have found a chromosomal translocation that is associated with over 90% of DFSP cases and is thought to be key to the development of this tumor. This translocation promotes growth of the tumor through platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) overproduction (Simon et al., 1997; Sirvent et al., 2003).

The incidence of DFSP in the United States has been estimated to be 0.8‚Äì4.5 per million persons per year (Gloster, 1996; Kreicher et al., 2016; Rouhani et al., 2008). In a 2016 report on the incidence and survival of DFSP using all 18 registries from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database through 2010, Kreicher et al. (2016) found that the overall incidence of DFSP was 4.1 per million person-years and was steady over the decade. They also found the incidence to be 1.14 times higher among women compared with men. The incidence among Blacks was nearly 2 times the incidence among whites. The trunk was the most common location, accounting for 41.6% of cases. The incidence of DFSP is highest in the 20- to 39-year age bracket (42% of cases) and the 40- to 59-year age bracket (37.7% of cases). Five-year and 10-year relative survival rates were found to be at 99.8% and 99.1%, respectively. Similar findings were found by Rouhani et al. in a 2008 report on population-based cancer incidence data from 1992 through 2004 among residents of the 13 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program registries (Rouhani et al., 2008).
Pathogenesis
Over 90% of DFSP cases are characterized by a translocation t(17;22). This translocation results in the fusion of the PDGF beta polypeptide (PDGFB gene) with the collagen type 1A1 (COL1A1) gene (Maki et al., 2002; Sandberg & Bridge, 2003). This fusion leads to overproduction of PDGF and continuous activation of the PDGFB receptor. This ultimately leads to increased cell proliferation and tumor formation. Although 34 different variants of this fusion gene have been recognized, there appears to be no association between the specific variant and the clinical characteristics of DFSP (Llombart et al., 2009). Two notable subtypes of DFSP that are well studied are the Bednar pigmented variant (<5% of cases) and the higher-grade fibrosarcomatous variant (5%‚Äì15% of cases). There are a few reasons why this fusion gene is clinically relevant. First, this fusion is found in the vast majority of DFSP cases and likely is fundamental to tumor development. Next, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used to detect these PDGF-B/COL1A1 fusion transcripts. Detecting these fusion transcripts can be used both for diagnostic purposes and for choosing the most appropriate treatment option (Patel et al., 2008). Last, the constitutive activation of PDGFB receptors that results from this fusion protein provides a potential target for future treatment modalities.
Clinical Features
DFSP is often asymptomatic initially. In most cases, the tumor has been present for many years by the time it is diagnosed (Mentzel et al., 1998). This tumor classically arises from the dermis as a plaque that grows progressively over the course of months to years. It can rarely present as a cutaneous nodule that is firm. The tumor arises as a pink, red, or violet plaque. These plaques can become telangiectatic over time with small, widened blood vessels becoming visible on the skin's surface (Lindner et al., 1999). The most common sites where lesions arise include the trunk (41.6%), upper limb (21.2%), lower limb (20.8%), and head (12.9%). Rarely, DFSP can arise from a tattoo or preexisting scar (De Antoni et al., 2020; Hirano & Torosky, 2012). Incidence rates appear to be highest in patients who are in their 30s (Bowne et al., 2000; Kreicher et al., 2016; Lindner et al., 1999). The tumor is commonly fixed to the dermis but may involve deeper subcutaneous tissues later in the disease course. Over time, the tumor may become a raised, firm nodule (Figure 1). Once the tumor takes a nodular form, the overlying skin may become shiny or ulcerated and may be painful.FIGURE 1.: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans presenting as a firm, pink nodule on the upper back of an 8-year-old child.At the time of diagnosis, DFSP remains superficial and has a diameter of less than 5 cm in most cases (Bowne et al., 2000). On occasion, these tumors can grow to become very large. If the tumor remains untreated, its growth generally accelerates. Accelerated growth can also occur during pregnancy (Har-Shai et al., 1993; Parlette et al., 1999).
The metastatic rate for low-grade DFSP is thought to be about 1% (Cai et al., 2012; Lemm et al., 2009). Malignancy is more common in patients who have had tumor recurrence and patients with the more malignant fibrosarcomatous variant of DFSP. Distant metastasis appears to primarily occur via the bloodstream, affecting the lungs most commonly. Spread to regional lymph nodes appears to be relatively rare, with regional lymph node metastases being observed in only three of the 260 patients with DFSP involved in a 2012 study (Cai et al., 2012).
DIAGNOSIS
Dermoscopy
Dermoscopy can be useful in the diagnostic workup of lesions if DFSP is suspected. DFSP should be suspected in all patients who present with a firm, slow-growing nodule. A 2013 study by Bernard et al. sought to describe the main dermoscopy findings in DFSP (Bernard et al., 2013). They did this by determining the frequency of six predefined dermoscopy findings among a group of 15 cases of biopsy-proven DFSP. The most common observed finding was a pigmented network, seen in 87% of lesions. The next most frequently observed findings were vessel structures (seen in 80% of lesions), structureless light-brown areas (73% of lesions), shiny white streaks (67% of lesions), pink background coloration (67% of lesions), and structureless hypopigmented/depigmented areas (60% of lesions). The median number of the predefined dermoscopy findings found per lesion was notably high at 4. Although none of the predefined dermoscopy findings are specific to DFSP, a collection of several of these findings should raise suspicion about this tumor. Importantly, no dermoscopy differences were found between low-grade DFSP and the fibrosarcomatous variant of DFSP. Furthermore, no differences were found on dermoscopy between primary lesions and lesions that were recurrent.
Dermoscopy can be utilized in differentiating DFSP from other similar lesions. Dermatofibromas are pedunculated lesions more typically seen in extremities. Cutaneous neurofibromas are skin-colored, rubbery nodules that grow slowly. Solitary fibrous tumors are slow-growing, skin-colored masses. Although dermoscopy can help distinguish lesions that warrant biopsy from those that are more likely benign, new and evolving skin lesions warrant biopsy in most cases.
Histopathology
Although dermoscopy can be helpful when DFSP is suspected, the diagnosis of this skin cancer requires an incisional or core needle biopsy. Of note, fine needle aspiration is not used for diagnosing primary DFSP but can be used for diagnosing recurrent disease.
DFSP appears poorly circumscribed and often infiltrates the full thickness of the dermis, destroying preexisting structures (Llombart et al., 2013). The tumor is composed of a dense array of monomorphic cells with spindle-shaped nuclei embedded in collagen. The tumor cells have large nuclei, rare mitotic figures, and limited size and shape variability. These proliferating cells are often arranged in fascicles that are irregular and interwoven. Higher cellularity is often seen centrally in the tumor, with peripheral areas being less cellular. This results in a storiform or irregularly whirled pattern (Llombart et al., 2013). The tumor cells can be arranged around a central hub, like the spokes of a wheel. Small amounts of mucin may be present beneath the epidermis. Often, the epidermis that overlies the tumor is thin with flattened rete ridges. Moderate epidermal thickening can less commonly be present.
The main characteristic of DFSP is its capacity to invade tissues surrounding the tumor. Invasion of surrounding tissue occurs through tentacle-like projections. Invasion of surrounding fat is said to occur in a ‚Äúhoneycomb‚Äù pattern of fat surrounded by infiltrating tumor cells or in a ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù pattern or spindle cell layers that run parallel to the surface of the skin (Bague & Folpe, 2008; Zelger et al., 1994). The histologic appearance of these invading projections often resembles normal fibrous tracts, possibly playing a role in the recurrence of DFSP in patients who were said to have excision with wide margins.
The histological appearance of the fibrosarcomatous variant of DFSP has a characteristic fascicular or herringbone architecture. This variant is generally more hypercellular, pleomorphic, mitotically active, and aggressive. It is also associated with an expansive pattern (Connelly & Evans, 1992; Llombart et al., 2013; Sanz-Trelles et al., 1998).
The histology of the Bednar pigmented variant of DFSP is characterized by a storiform pattern of spindle cells with melanin-containing dendritic cells (Llombart et al., 2013). The histologic population of melanin-containing cells is variable among Bednar tumors. The density of melanin-containing cells correlates with the appearance of the tumor grossly, with some tumors having such a low density of these cells that they do not grossly appear pigmented and can only be defined as Bednar tumors following biopsy.
Immunohistochemistry
DFSP characteristically stains positive for CD34 and negative for Factor XIIIa (Caccavale et al., 2022). Staining positive for CD34 helps differentiate DFSP from other soft tissue tumors, such as dermatofibroma. Approximately 80%‚Äì100% of DFSP tumors stain positive for CD34, whereas about 95% of dermatofibromas stain negatively for CD34 (Abenoza & Lillemoe, 1993; Haycox et al., 1997; Kamino et al., 1992; Zelger et al., 1994). Importantly, the sarcomatous component of the fibrosarcomatous variant of DFSP does not stain positive for CD34, which can be helpful in differentiating this variant from other forms of DFSP.
Molecular Testing
FISH and RT-PCR techniques can both be useful in diagnosing DFSP by detecting the translocation t(17;22). Although the use of these molecular techniques is often not required for the diagnosis of DFSP, detecting this translocation is useful for predicting how a patient will respond to treatment. Patients with this translocation respond particularly well to imatinib. This translocation, resulting in overproduction of PDGF and continuous activation of the PDGFB receptor, is present in over 90% of DFSP cases. Both techniques have been shown to have a specificity of 100% for detecting the PDGFB/COL1A1 transcript. FISH, however, has been shown to be more sensitive (90% sensitive) compared with RT-PCR (72% sensitive) for detecting this transcript (Salgado et al., 2011).
Staging
Although there are several staging systems used worldwide, many clinicians in the United States stage DFSP using the American Musculoskeletal Tumor Society staging system. This staging system was first defined by Enneking et al. in 1980 and is based on histological grade (low vs. high) and anatomic compartment confinement (intercompartmental vs. extracompartmental). Stage I is defined in this grading system as low grade, with Stage IA representing intracompartmental confinement and Stage IB representing extracompartmental tumors. Stage II is defined by being high grade, with Stage IIA representing intracompartmental confinement and Stage IIB representing extracompartmental tumors. Stage III is reserved for tumors with systemic or regional metastases (Enneking et al., 1980).
TREATMENT
The preferred treatment for DFSP is resection with negative margins. The size and location of the tumor are both important factors when determining the most appropriate surgical procedure. It is very important to achieve negative margins because failure to do so increases the risk of locally recurrent disease that is associated with a higher risk of more aggressive and metastatic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful preoperatively to better define tumor extension before surgery. The preferred treatment option is Mohs micrographic surgery (Paradisi et al., 2008; Shah et al., 2021). This technique is particularly useful in DFSP because clear histopathologic margins are confirmed during the surgical procedure. Recurrence rates after Mohs micrographic surgery are around 1%‚Äì1.5% (Foroozan et al., 2012; Martin et al., 2022). If Mohs surgery is not available, wide local excision may be performed with 2- to 4-cm margins. Even with wide local excision and clear margins, the local recurrence of DFSP is 4%‚Äì9% (Foroozan et al., 2012; Martin et al., 2022). Careful clinical examination of regional lymph nodes in the preoperative and postoperative periods can be useful for conservatively assessing lymph node metastasis in patients with diagnosed DFSP (Mavili et al., 1994). Lymph node dissection is not generally recommended.
Imatinib mesylate is a medication that is FDA approved for the treatment of DFSP. Imatinib has been shown to be safe and effective for use in adult patients who have unresectable, recurrent, and/or metastatic DFSP. This medication is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that competitively inhibits adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding to the PDGFB receptor. This promotes apoptosis and limits tumor growth. Patients should be screened for the translocation t(17;22) before treatment, as patients with this translocation respond particularly well to imatinib mesylate (65% response rate).
Radiation is rarely used as the primary treatment for DFSP but can be used as adjuvant therapy in some cases. Radiation has been shown to decrease the risk of recurrence when used in addition to surgery (Dagan et al., 2005; Haas et al., 1997; Sun et al., 2000). For patients with lymph node involvement, lymphadenectomy is recommended. Surgical resection may be appropriate for some patients with isolated sites of metastasis.
FOLLOW-UP
Because of the recurrent nature of DFSP, close clinical follow-up after treatment is important. Although recurrence rates are highest within 3 years of treatment, 25%‚Äì30% of recurrent DFSP cases occur more than 5 years after treatment. Because of this significant risk for recurrence, it is recommended that patients be seen every 6 months for the first 3 years and then annually for the rest of their life (Llombart et al., 2013). Routine imaging is generally not recommended for patients with DFSP unless symptoms suggest metastasis. Some symptoms that may suggest DFSP metastasis include fatigue, weight loss, shortness of breath, and loss of appetite. Some sources suggest routine imaging in patients with the fibrosarcomatous variant of DFSP because of its higher potential for metastasis.
KEY CONCEPTS

DFSP is a relatively rare, soft tissue tumor that arises from the dermis.
Although DFSP is generally low-to-intermediate grade, it has a high propensity for local recurrence unless completely excised.
Over 90% of DFSP cases are characterized by a translocation t(17;22) that results in overproduction of PDGF and continuous activation of the PDGFB receptor. This ultimately leads to increased cell proliferation and tumor formation.
This tumor classically arises from the dermis as a plaque that grows progressively over the course of months to years. This tumor arises as a pink or violet‚Äìred plaque that can become telangiectatic over time. This tumor most commonly arises on the patient's trunk and is most common in patients in their 30s.
The definitive diagnosis of DFSP requires an incisional or core needle biopsy.
The preferred initial treatment option for localized DFSP is resection with negative margins. Mohs micrographic surgery is associated with recurrence rates of 1%‚Äì1.5%.
Imatinib mesylate is an FDA-approved medication that is safe and effective for adult patients with unresectable, recurrent, and/or metastatic DFSP.
Because of the significant risk for tumor recurrence, it is recommended that patients be seen every 6 months for the first 3 years after treatment and then annually for the rest of their life.
Five-year and 10-year relative survival rates of DFSP have been estimated to be 99.8% and 99.1%, respectively.

Abstract:
  Simple SummaryMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive skin cancer and the second cause of skin cancer death after melanoma. MCC is an immunogenic tumor. In recent years, the use of immunotherapy has changed the treatment landscape for patients with metastatic MCC, significantly improving the prognosis. However, the five-year disease-specific survival remains around 64%, underlying the unmet need for novel treatments. This review recapitulates current knowledge about MCC pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. Emphasis is given to the use of immunotherapy and targeted therapies as well as to future therapeutic perspectives in the neoadjuvant setting and for locally advanced and metastatic MCC.  AbstractMCC is a rare but highly aggressive skin cancer. The identification of the driving role of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) and ultraviolet-induced DNA damage in the oncogenesis of MCC allowed a better understanding of its biological behavior. The presence of MCPyV-specific T cells and lymphocytes exhibiting an ‚Äòexhausted‚Äô phenotype in the tumor microenvironment along with the high prevalence of immunosuppression among affected patients are strong indicators of the immunogenic properties of MCC. The use of immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of patients with advanced MCC with anti-PD-1/PD L1 blockade, providing objective responses in as much as 50‚Äì70% of cases when used in first-line treatment. However, acquired resistance or contraindication to immune checkpoint inhibitors can be an issue for a non-negligible number of patients and novel therapeutic strategies are warranted. This review will focus on current management guidelines for MCC and future therapeutic perspectives for advanced disease with an emphasis on molecular pathways, targeted therapies, and immune-based strategies. These new therapies alone or in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors could enhance immune responses against tumor cells and overcome acquired resistance to immunotherapy.

  1. IntroductionMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive, neuroendocrine malignancy of the skin, first described by Toker in 1972 [1]. MCC presents a Merkel cell-like phenotype, suggesting for many years its origin from the Merkel cells of the skin. Currently, this origin of MCC is being disputed and the phenotypic similarities of MCC with Merkel cells are rather considered to result from a strong differentiation process and do not necessarily reflect cell ancestry [2,3,4]. MCC usually affects the elderly, with a median age of diagnosis between 75 and 79 years, but cases of younger, mainly immunosuppressed patients, have been reported [5]. MCC occurs predominantly in men with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1 [5,6]. The white population has a 25-times greater risk of MCC, particularly of the head and neck [6,7,8]. Immunosuppression such as transplantation, HIV infection, and hematologic malignancies is present in 10% of cases and is associated with a worse prognosis [9,10]. There is a 10-fold increase in incidence in solid organ transplant recipients and a 13.4-fold increase among HIV patients [11,12].According to the SEER-18 Database of the National Cancer Institute in the United States, including 6600 MCC cases from 2000 to 2013, there is a 0.7 cases/100,000 person-year incidence and a 95% increase in reported MCC cases in the last years [5]. This increase can be explained by the greater diagnostic awareness of physicians, the improved immunohistochemistry diagnostic techniques (CK20 antibody use), and the aging and subsequent immune-senescence of a sun-exposed population [13]. European registries show comparable incidence rates [14], whereas the highest rates of MCC are reported in Australia [13]. MCC is the second deadliest skin malignancy after melanoma, with a case-by-case fatality rate worse than stage-matched melanomas [15]. Although its incidence is low, MCC has a strong propensity to recur locally, spread regionally to the lymph node (LN) basin, and disseminate. In most cases, patients are diagnosed with a locoregionally advanced disease [16] with an estimated five-year disease-specific survival of around 64% [17].  2. Disease PathogenesisUltraviolet radiation (UV) and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) infection seem to be the main oncogenic factors of MCC. The breakthrough discovery in 2008 by Feng et al. by digital transcriptome subtraction of MCPyV clonally integrated into the tumor cell genome led to a greater understanding of the pathways of oncogenesis and the molecular biology of MCC [18]. MCPyV is a commensal, ubiquitous virus acquired most frequently in early childhood, responsible for an asymptomatic life-long infection as a resident of the skin flora. MCPyV infection prevalence among adults aged 60‚Äì69 years is around 81%, with a trend of higher seroprevalence with increasing age [19]. MCPyV is considered responsible for 80% of MCC tumors [20]. The oncogenicity of MCPyV in only a small subset of infected individuals denotes the importance of additional viral truncating mutations/deletions along with a loss of immune surveillance for tumorigenesis. The virus integrates into the host DNA, driving the durable expression of two viral T-antigens, large T (LT) and small T (ST), that alter the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and other cellular pathways involved in cell transformation [21,22]. MCPyV LT specifically inhibits retinoblastoma (RB) function but cannot bind p53 [22,23]. Co-expression of ST prevents LT degradation, increases steady-state LT levels, and has been shown to enhance viral replication [24].On the other hand, MCPyV-negative MCC have a high mutational burden with prominent UV-signature DNA damage affecting various oncogenes. Among these, mutations of the tumor suppressor genes RB1 and TP53, mutations promoting the activation of the PI3K pathway (HRAS, KRAS), and inactivation of the Notch pathway appear to be critical oncogenic events [25]. Virus-negative MCCs have a mutational burden that is, on average, 100-fold greater than MCPyV-positive MCC [25]. It is uncertain whether a hit-and-run phenomenon with initial MCPyV integration and secondary loss of addiction to the viral T-antigens could trigger MCPyV-negative tumors [26]. Despite conflicting data, MCPyV-negative tumors seem to be more aggressive, with more frequent locoregional or distant metastasis at diagnosis and a more reserved disease-specific survival [20].The cell of origin of MCC remains unknown. The observation of collision tumors, i.e., MCC with squamous cell carcinoma, the frequent occurrence of MCC on the head and neck region, and the high burden of somatic mutations with a UV signature suggest that MCPyV-negative cases could derive from a progenitor cell of the epidermis. In contrast, the lack of connection between tumor cells and the epidermis and the absence of a UV signature could favor a non-epithelial origin for MCPyV-positive MCC, with the most probable candidate being dermal fibroblasts [3]. A cell culture model for MCPyV infection could be established using dermal fibroblasts but not CK20-positive Merkel cells. Furthermore, only dermal cells expressing fibroblast markers were capable of expressing the MCPyV LT and ST antigens [4]. If this theory is confirmed, MCC could be the only tumor originating from two distinct germ layers: MCPyV-negative MCCs from ectodermal keratinocytes and MCPyV-positive MCCs from mesodermal fibroblasts [3]. Other putative cells of origin include pre/Pro B cells [2,3,4].MCC is an immune-sensitive tumor, as highlighted by the association between survival and intra-tumoral levels of cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes [27] and of MCPyV-specific T cells [28,29], as well as the identification of specific circulating antibodies that fluctuate along with disease activity [30]. Lymphocytes of the tumor microenvironment exhibit an ‚Äúexhausted‚Äù phenotype with increased expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) [31] and an increase in CD4+ and CD8+ regulatory T cells (Treg), confirming that loss of immune-surveillance is a key point in the immunoediting process of MCC [31].  3. Diagnosis  3.1. Clinical ExaminationMCC usually presents as a firm, painless, nodular, or plaque-like, flesh-colored to red-violet lesion, with a high affinity for the head and neck or upper extremities (Figure 1). Rapidly growing lesions can be associated with ulceration and necrosis. Its most important features are represented by the acronym AEIOU: Asymptomatic/lack of tenderness, Expanding rapidly, Immune deficiency, age Older than 50 years, and UV exposure [9]. In a prospective study of 195 patients, the primary tumor size ranged from <1 cm in 21.3%, 1‚Äì2 cm in 43.3%, and >2 cm in 35.3% of cases [9]. The presence of nonspecific clinical features in MCC may lead to a diagnostic delay.  3.2. Histopathology of the Primary TumorA biopsy of a suspicious lesion is required for the diagnosis of MCC, followed by an immunopanel analysis. In hematoxylin-eosin staining, MCCs are dermal tumors composed of small, round, basophilic cells arranged in sheets or trabecular arrays (Figure 2). MCC cells have round, hyperchromatic nuclei with dusty (salt-and-pepper) chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm with neuroendocrine granules (Figure 3). A high mitotic rate is frequent as well as vascular invasion and an abundant inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells surrounding the tumor. A band between the tumor and the epidermis is usually present. Cases of in situ MCC have been reported in the form of collision tumors [32]. Three histological patterns have been described (trabecular, intermediate, and small-cell) with no clear histo-prognostic association [33].Diagnosis using light microscopy alone can lead to a wrong diagnosis in 60% of primary tumors and 40% of LN examinations [34]. Immunohistochemical staining is required to exclude possible mimickers, such as small-cell lung carcinoma metastasis, lymphoma, and small-cell melanoma. Tumor cells in MCC typically express markers of neuroendocrine and epithelial differentiation, such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE), CD56, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and low molecular weight cytokeratins (CK8, CK18, CK19, CK20), CAM 5.2, and AE1/AE3 [35,36,37]. CK20 is a diagnostic marker with high sensitivity and specificity. CK20 is positive in 80% of biopsies with characteristic membranous, punctate, and/or ‚Äòparanuclear dot-like patterns‚Äô [35]. Another characteristic is also the absence of expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and CK7, usually present in small-cell lung cancer, of leucocyte common antigen (LCA) which is positive in lymphoma, and of S100 and HMB45, which are positive in melanoma [36]. Expression of CK20 with the concomitant absence of TTF-1 expression is diagnostic for MCC in 90% of cases [37]. CM2B4, a monoclonal antibody generated against a predicted antigenic epitope on the MCPyV-T-antigen, can be a useful reagent for the diagnosis of MCPyV-positive MCC [38].  4. Disease Workup and Staging  4.1. Baseline ImagingAfter the diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy, a total body examination including LN evaluation for clinically detectable metastasis must be performed. In a recent study, the benefit of baseline imaging was confirmed, allowing the upstaging in 13.2% of cases (8.9% in locoregional and 4.3% in distant metastatic disease) among 492 MCC patients with clinically uninvolved LN [38]. In another study including 92 patients with MCC and clinically involved LN, systematic imaging revealed distant metastasis in 10.8% of cases, highlighting the further utility of baseline imaging even in the setting of clinically localized disease [39]. Thus, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend a systematic baseline cross-sectional imaging at diagnosis [40]. The preferred imaging modalities are ultrasound of the locoregional LN, whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT), or thoracic, abdomen, and pelvis CT with contrast, with an additional neck CT (if the primary tumor is located on the head and neck area) [40,41,42]. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast is indicated if there is clinical suspicion of brain metastasis and systematically in stage T2‚ÄìT4 tumors and unknown primaries [43]. PET-CT seems to perform better than CT alone in the detection of occult disease, particularly for bone/bone marrow lesions [39,44].Serological assessment of MCPyV-oncoprotein antibodies (against the viral capsid protein VP1) can be considered as part of the baseline workup [40]. Seropositivity can be present in almost half of MCC patients [30]. Seronegative patients are at almost 40% higher risk of recurrence and could benefit from more intensive surveillance [30]. MCPyV antibody status should be tested within the first three months of diagnosis as titers are expected to decrease after clinically evident disease is eliminated [30].  4.2. Evaluation of the Lymph Node StatusOccult LN metastasis can be detected in 20‚Äì40% of MCC patients, at the time of diagnosis and independently of the primary tumor size [16,16,45,46]. Thus, LN status should be determined systematically at diagnosis as it is an important staging tool and an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) [17,40,41,46,47]. If LN metastasis is clinically detected, imaging studies and subsequent exploratory lymphadenectomy should be performed. All other cases should undergo a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Ideally, SLNB should be performed alongside primary tumor-wide local excision (WLE) or precede it to avoid WLE-related lymphatic drainage modifications. SNLB evaluation should include an appropriate immunopanel analysis. SLNB-negative patients have an excellent 5-year survival of 97% [17]. False-negative SLNB results are expected in 17% of cases [48]. Even lower success rates of SNLB (45%) are typically reported in head and neck primaries, probably due to the complexity of drainage patterns [46]. If SLNB cannot be performed or is unsuccessful, the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) guidelines suggest close follow-up with clinical examination and LN ultrasound every four months, whereas NCCN guidelines propose adjuvant radiotherapy (aRT) of the draining nodal basin identified by lymphoscintigraphy [40,42].  4.3. Eighth Edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging for MCC and Prognostic FactorsThe stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis is the most critical prognostic factor of survival [16,17,47]. The 8th edition AJCC staging system for MCC was published in 2017, based on an analysis of over 9000 patients included in the National Cancer Database, from 1998 to 2012 [47]. In this population, 5-year OS estimates for local disease (n = 6138), regional metastatic disease (n = 2465), and distant metastatic disease (n = 784) were 50.6%, 35.4%, and 13.5%, respectively [47]. In this latest Edition, tumor size remained an important predictor of survival, but two additional independent prognostic factors were considered. For primary tumors ‚â§ 2 cm, 5-year OS was improved when the negativity of LN status was confirmed pathologically versus clinically (62.8% versus 45%) [47], reflecting the obvious fact that clinically negative LN includes both node-negative and occult node-positive patients. Thus, in local disease stages I and II, clinical and pathological LN statuses were separated. Another change from the past Edition results from the observation that 5-year OS estimates for patients with ‚Äúunknown primaries‚Äù and clinically and pathologically metastatic LNs were 42.2%, compared with 26.8% for those with a known primary tumor [47]. This subgroup of patients represents 5% of all MCC patients but almost 40% of patients with clinically detected LN disease. To reflect this improved prognosis, these nodal status ‚Äúunknown primaries‚Äù patients were reclassified at stage IIIA (previous stage IIIB of the 7th Edition). This survival benefit is probably an indicator of an effective cell-mediated immune response responsible for the regression of the primary tumor in this subgroup [47,49].Other parameters can have prognostic significance as well, though they are not included in the AJCC staging system [50]. With regards to the primary tumor, location on the head and neck, an infiltrative tumor growth pattern, increased tumor thickness, presence of more than 10 mitoses/high-power field, and lymphovascular invasion are associated with poorer prognosis. On the other hand, the presence of brisk tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is associated with improved survival. Poor prognostic factors related to the LN basin include the extent of metastatic LN involvement, large or multifocal metastatic deposits, and extracapsular extension [17]. According to a single-institution study in patients with a single positive LN, the 5-year survival rate was 66%, with 2‚Äì4 positive LNs was 62%, and with >4 positive LNs was 30% [17]. Patient-related factors associated with the worst prognosis include male sex, younger age, immunosuppression, and MCPyV seronegativity [10,30,51].  5. Treatment of the Primary TumorConsidering the rarity of MCC and its complex management, patients should be referred, when possible, to a multidisciplinary team of trained specialists in reference centers, to establish a personalized treatment plan taking into consideration disease staging, patients‚Äô general condition, and comorbidities [43].  5.1. Surgical Management of the Primary Tumor and the Draining Lymphatic BasinSurgical excision followed by aRT is the treatment of choice for primary tumors [40,42]. Wide local excision (WLE) with 1‚Äì2 cm margins is proposed, mirroring melanoma practices, to guarantee disease-free margins and the removal of potential microscopic satellite metastases [40,42]. Microscopically positive margins after surgical excision relate to a higher local recurrence rate compared to microscopically negative margins (18% versus 8%) [17]. Primary closure should be prioritized, to allow the prompt initiation of aRT on the tumor bed. Complex reconstruction techniques should only be applied if necessary and after negative margins and SLNB results are obtained.The choice of 1‚Äì2 cm-wide margins in WLE has not been evaluated in a prospective, randomized setting, but seems to be an independent factor of improved OS [52]. In a recent, single-institution study of 188 MCC cases without clinical LN involvement, surgical margins ‚â• 1 cm were associated with a lower local recurrence rate. However, for patients who received aRT on the tumor bed, local control was excellent even in the case of microscopically positive margins on WLE, suggesting that, in selected cases, when tissue-sparing is mandated, narrower margins combined with aRT could be accepted [53].A recent systematic review confirmed that Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is non-inferior to WLE in terms of the locoregional recurrence rate with the advantage of tissue-sparing [54] and can be applied when 1‚Äì2 cm margins are not feasible [40]. Nevertheless, in a study of 1795 patients with stage I and II MCC, MMS failed to prove an OS benefit over WLE, for now limiting its generalization as the treatment of choice for MCC primary tumors [55].With regards to the draining LN basin, current guidelines propose a complete LN dissection (CLND) if SLNB or if the exploratory lymphadenectomy of a clinically detectable LN are positive [40,41]. A survival advantage of CLND over observation remains, however, unclear due to the lack of randomized data [40,41,46,48].  5.2. Radiation TherapyMCC is a highly radiosensitive tumor. aRT of the primary tumor bed is recommended after WLE [40,41,42,52]. NCCN guidelines suggest prompt initiation of radiotherapy of the primary tumor site as soon as wound healing permits, with a dosage of 50‚Äì56 Gy if resection margins are negative, 56‚Äì60 Gy if microscopically positive, 60‚Äì66 Gy if WLE was not possible, while according to EDF guidelines a dosage of 50 Gy on the tumor region and 10 more on the tumor bed is recommended. In a meta-analysis of 1254 patients whose primary tumor was treated with WLE, local 5-year recurrences were 3 times (p < 0.001) and regional recurrences 2 times less probable (p < 0.001), when aRT of the tumor bed was administered [56].NCCN recommends irradiation of the nodal basin on a case-by-case basis [40]. aRT could be interesting in cases of potentially false-negative SLNB (i.e., head and neck tumors, absence of immunopanel), in SNLB-negative immunosuppressed patients, or if SLNB was not performed. In cases of positive SLNB, aRT of 50‚Äì60 Gy is recommended after CLND only for patients with multiple LN involvement or extracapsular extension. Irradiation in the presence of micro-metastasis does not seem to have an impact on OS, although it has been shown to improve local control, significantly decreasing the risk of locoregional recurrence [57]. Radiation therapy may be considered as an alternative to surgical treatment for the management of primary or nodal disease in patients not eligible for surgery.Hypofractionated radiotherapy with 10 fractions of 3.5 Gy could be an interesting option for the adjuvant treatment of the tumor bed and LN basin, with the advantage of reduced morbidity and treatment durations (NCT05100095, ongoing trial).  5.3. Patient Follow-Up after Excision of the Primary Tumor and the Draining Lymphatic BasinApproximately 40% of MCC recur, and 80% of recurrences occur within 2 years of the initial diagnosis [17]. The median time-to-recurrence is 8 to 9 months [58]. Distant recurrences occur in about half of the patients, whereas LN recurrences and local or in-transit recurrences occur in approximately 25% of patients each [51,58,59]. As a result, a more intense surveillance schedule is recommended for the first three years that gradually decreases afterward, reflecting the diminishing risk of recurrence after three years [40,41,42].For the first three years, follow-up should include clinical examination with LN palpation and LN ultrasound at three- to six-month intervals [40,41,42]. The frequency of surveillance can then be reduced to 6- to 12-month intervals for the following 2 years and then annually for life [40,41,42]. Whole-body CT or PET-CT with brain MRI with contrast may be proposed for high-risk, i.e., immunosuppressed, patients annually for the first five years. The 2018 German guidelines propose cross-sectional imaging (CT or PET-CT and cranial MRI) at three-month intervals for the first two years and then semiannually for up to five years for patients with positive or indeterminate SNLB status, due to their markedly poorer prognosis [41].The sequential serological determination of MCPyV antibodies can be included in the monitoring of MCC patients that were seropositive at baseline [40]. Rapidly rising titers can be an early indicator of recurrence [30], reducing the need for close imaging follow-up in these patients. An ongoing, prospective study assesses the role of two blood biomarkers, MCPyV T-Ag antibodies and cell-free miR-375, as a surrogate of tumor burden in a cohort of 150 European patients (NCT04705389).  6. Treatment of Locally Advanced and Metastatic Disease  6.1. In-Transit and Local RecurrencesThere is no evidence-based approach for the treatment of locoregional recurrences. In a retrospective, single-center analysis, 70 patients with locoregional MCC recurrences received either surgery or chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and palliative care [59]. The 3-year locoregional recurrence-free survival was 75% and the distant recurrence-free survival was 56%. In multivariate analysis, radiotherapy was associated with a nearly 80% reduction in mortality. Nodal status at baseline and time-to-first recurrence were important predictors of distant recurrence and OS [59].According to current guidelines, local or in-transit and LN metastases should be surgically removed, if feasible [40,41,42]. When surgery is not feasible, radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy may be used [40,41,42]. Nodal restaging seems to be beneficial in case of locoregional recurrence since as many as 25% of patients can have synchronous or subsequent LN metastasis [59].  6.2. Distant Metastases  6.2.1. Conventional ChemotherapyThe chemotherapeutic regimens of metastatic MCC are based on the treatment of small-cell lung carcinoma due to the similar neuroendocrine properties of both neoplasms [3,60,61] and include:-Platinum agents (carboplatin or cisplatinum agents (carboplatin or cisplatin) with etoposide and topotecan.-Cyclophosphamide, often with doxorubicin/epirubicin and vincristine, or with methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil.-Paclitaxel and a variety of other agents.MCC is a chemosensitive tumor, but responses are short-lived. MCC chemotherapy is related to limited survival, important toxicity, and frequently acquired resistance. First-line chemotherapeutic regimens present up to 70% objective response rates (ORR), with a median response duration ranging from 3 to 10 months, whereas second- or later-line regimens have an ORR of 9‚Äì45% with a mean duration of 2 months [3,60,61].Adjuvant chemotherapy has been proposed in the past in patients at high-risk of recurrence but failed to show any survival benefit at the cost of increased toxicities [10,17]. With MCC being an immune-sensitive tumor, chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression in the adjuvant setting could even have a negative impact on long-term outcomes.  6.2.2. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI)The expression of viral oncoproteins in MCPyV-positive cancer cells, the high mutational burden in MCPyV-negative tumors and in the tumor micro-environment, and the clinical association with immunosuppression make MCC a good candidate for immunotherapy. PD-L1 is expressed by tumor cells in MCPyV-negative tumors, while cases with MCPyV-positive tumors are characterized by tumor-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells targeting MCPyV oncoproteins and expressing PD-L1 and PD-1 [62,63]. Restoration of anti-tumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment through the use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors such as Avelumab, Pembrolizumab, and Nivolumab became the standard of care in the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic MCC in the last 5 years [40]. These agents have high efficacy, especially when administered as first-line agents (50‚Äì70%), while objective responses are observed in approximately 30% of patients in second- or later-line agents (Table 1).Avelumab, a fully human IgG1, anti- PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, received accelerated approval in 2017 in America and Europe and in 2018 in Australia and Japan, for patients with metastatic MCC regardless of treatment history, based on the results of an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase II trial: the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial part A. This study included 88 patients with stage IV chemotherapy-refractory MCC who received avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The ORR was 33%, with 11.4% complete and 21.6% partial responses, and most importantly durable responses confirmed by a median duration of response of 40.5 months [63,64,65]. Treatment-related adverse events were reported by 76% of patients, but most were low-grade (fatigue, infusion reactions) [64,65].In the recently published results of the JAVELIN Merkel 200 part B study, avelumab used as first-line treatment allowed objective responses in 40% and durable responses (lasting ‚â•6 months) in 30% of 116 patients with metastatic MCC [66]. Real-life data from 2015 to 2018, from the expanded access program (EAP) of Avelumab, confirmed an ORR of 46.7% among 240 evaluable patients with metastatic MCC and a median duration of treatment of 7.9 months [67]. Avelumab is currently evaluated as an adjuvant treatment in MCC patients with LN metastasis at a high risk of recurrence (stages IIA‚ÄìIIB) (NCT03271372, ADAM trial).Pembrolizumab, a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was the second ICI approved on December 2018 for the treatment of recurrent, locally advanced, and metastatic MCC, based on data of a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label trial: KEYNOTE-017. The ORR was 56%, with 24% complete responses in 50 treatment-naive patients receiving 2 mg/kg of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks [68,69]. The 24-month OS rate was 68.7% [68]. Pembrolizumab is currently evaluated in the adjuvant setting in patients with stage I‚ÄìIIIB MCC following initial surgery (NCT03712605).Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4, anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. The phase I/II single-arm, open-label, CheckMate358 trial of nivolumab at a dose of 240‚Äâmg/kg every 2‚Äâweeks in 22 patients with advanced MCC showed objective responses in 71% of treatment-na√Øve patients and in 63% of patients with one or more previous therapies [70]. The ORR was 68% and the 3-month OS was 92%. Nivolumab administered 4 and 2 weeks before surgery allowed presurgical pathological tumor regression in 47.2% of 36 patients with high-risk MCC, with good tolerance [71]. An international, open-label, randomized, multicenter phase 2 study assessing the efficacy of adjuvant nivolumab in MCC patients with a resected primary tumor is ongoing (NCT02196961).Ipilimumab is a human IgG1, anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody that restores tumor immunity at the priming phase in the LN and has been approved since 2011 for advanced melanoma. Since the arrival of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, ipilimumab is no longer used as monotherapy or as a first-line agent due to its significant immune-related toxicity. In a small retrospective study, 3/5 patients with avelumab-refractory metastatic MCC responded to the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab [72]. In an ongoing phase 2 trial, patients were randomized to receive either nivolumab and ipilimumab (Arm A) or the combination with stereotactic body radiation therapy (Arm B), as a second-line treatment. Preliminary encouraging data on 16 of 50 included patients are available, showing an ORR of 80% for Arm A versus 17% for Arm B, with an acceptable safety profile [73]. A phase 2 trial of ipilimumab as an adjuvant therapy failed to demonstrate a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival after a median follow-up of almost 2 years, with substantial toxicity in the treatment arm, leading to its premature interruption [74].Table S1 in the Supplementary Materials depicts all currently available clinical trials for ICI in combination with targeted or immune-based therapies for advanced unresectable or metastatic MCC, and Table S2 shows all available clinical trials with ICI.In patients with primary or acquired resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, different strategies are being evaluated:Association with radiotherapy: Radiotherapy could induce an immunogenic cell death, potentiating the effect of ICI. In two patients with progressive metastatic MCC on anti-PD-1 inhibitors, single-fraction palliative radiotherapy induced durable in-field and abscopal responses [75]. Two ongoing, phase II trials evaluate the association of either pembrolizumab or nivolumab and ipilimumab, respectively, with stereotactic body radiation therapy in metastatic MCC patients (NCT03304639, NCT03071406) [73].Switching between different anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors or adding ipilimumab could overcome resistance to ICI [72,76]. In a case series of 13 ICI refractory patients, sequentially administered salvage therapy with anti-CTLA4 alone or in combination with an anti-PD1/PD-L1 inhibitor allowed objective responses in 31% of cases [76].Combination of ICI with targeted or other immune-based therapies (see Table S3 in the Supplementary Materials).To date, there are no available data concerning the appropriate duration of ICI treatment after the achievement of disease control and the optimal therapeutic sequences. Patients and physicians avoid stopping treatment due to fear of relapse, whereas over-treatment may increase toxicity and be inefficient. Ongoing strategic clinical trials seek to evaluate the length and optimal schedule of ICI treatments in responders with solid tumors, including MCC (NCT04157985, NCT05078047).Head-to-head studies comparing the efficacy and safety of different immunotherapies for the management of locally advanced or metastatic MCC are lacking. To date, avelumab and pembrolizumab remain the only ICIs with FDA and EMA approval for this indication. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis summarized the efficacy and safety of ICI in patients with MCC [77]. Six clinical trials of a total of 201 patients were included [77]. First-line treatment with nivolumab and pembrolizumab showed a higher ORR (68% and 57%, respectively) compared to the avelumab study (ORR 41%) involving patients with prior systemic therapies [77]. These results could reflect the tendency towards better ORR and survival outcomes when ICIs are used in the first-line setting [77]. Furthermore, better responses in the pembrolizumab study could be due to the inclusion of some stage IIIB patients, while in the avelumab study all patients were stage IV. In terms of safety, patients treated with nivolumab had the fewest adverse events but had the shortest FU, once again limiting the extrapolation of these results [77].There is an unmet need for predictive biomarkers of response to ICI in MCC. Different potential predictors have been assessed in MCC, such as clinical features, serum markers, PD-L1 expression, TIL, and genetic alterations [78]. Among clinical factors, a better performance status, the absence of immunosuppression, the early line of therapy, and a body mass index > 30 kg/m2 seem associated with a favorable response [78]. Kacew et al. recently suggested that a good clinical response correlated with less advanced stages of disease at baseline and shorter disease-free intervals between initial treatment and recurrence [79]. PD-L1+ expression (‚â•1%, evaluated with immunohistochemistry) and MCPyV tumoral status do not seem to have prognostic value, confirming the complex mechanisms of action of ICI [63,65,68,77,79]. On the other hand, PD-1 and PD-L1 density, PD-L1/PD-1 proximity, and the presence of TIL with a low T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality and a high TCR diversity seem to be positive predictors [63,80]. A recent study in multiple metastatic tumors has identified an important mutational burden and low copy-number alterations as independent response predictors [81]. Unfortunately, patients with MCC were not included in this study [81].  6.2.3. Promising Novel TherapiesA non-negligible percentage of patients present a primary or acquired resistance or a contraindication to ICI, i.e., organ transplant, HIV, or severe autoimmune disease. For these patients, treatment options likely to result in durable responses are limited and inclusion in clinical trials is warranted [40]. All currently ongoing clinical studies for the treatment of advanced unresectable or metastatic MCC with targeted therapies and immune-based strategies are resumed in Table S3 of the Supplementary Materials.  Targeted TherapiesTargeted therapies seem to provide limited but durable results with a good tolerance profile in a subset of patients and could be considered in the therapeutic armamentarium of metastatic MCC in selected, ICI-refractory cases. Furthermore, the combination of targeted therapies with immune-based treatments could help through a synergistic action to optimize outcomes.  Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Receptor InhibitorsPazopanib and cabozantinib are multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block VEGFR and c-kit signaling pathways, necessary for tumor angiogenesis, growth, and survival. Pazopanib also inhibits the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor. These molecules can also modulate the tumor microenvironment by reducing the number and function of Treg cells [82]. An immunohistochemistry study of 32 MCC tumors found the expression of VEGF-A in 91% of samples, VEGFR-2 in 88%, VEGF-C in 75%, and PDGF-alpha in 72%, but only a mild expression of c-kit (7%) and PDGF-beta (13%) and no expression of epidermal growth factor receptor or Her-2/Neu [83]. These results along with encouraging data from case reports/series supported the use of pazopanib and cabozantinib in clinical trials for metastatic MCC [84]. In a phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study, 9 out of 16 patients with metastatic MCC treated with pazopanib of 600 or 800 mg daily had a clinical benefit, with a median PFS of 3.2 months and a median OS of 6.4 months. The study was stopped prematurely due to low accrual [85]. Similarly, a single-arm, phase 2 study with cabozantinib in patients with recurrent/metastatic MCC was stopped prematurely due to poor tolerability and a lack of efficacy [86].  KIT InhibitorsMost MCC tumors express KIT but not activating mutations in the KIT gene‚Äôs hot-spot regions (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) [83,87]. Co-expression of KIT and its ligand, stem cell factor, in 75% of MCC tumors suggested an autocrine activation of KIT as a possible early event in MCC transformation and differentiation [88]. Blockade of KIT and the downstream signaling cascade resulted in inhibition growth in an MCC-1 cell line in vitro [89]. In the clinical setting, however, imatinib mesylate, a c-kit inhibitor, failed to demonstrate efficacy, with only 1 among 25 patients with metastatic/unresectable MCC experiencing a partial response and a median PFS of 1 month [90].  Somatostatin AnalogsMCC is a poorly differentiated, high-grade neuroendocrine tumor with some degree of expression of somatostatin receptors in 85% of patients that could subsequently benefit from somatostatin analog treatments [91]. In a retrospective series of 7 patients with metastatic MCC treated with octreotide and lanreotide, 3 experienced disease control with a median PFS of 237 days [91]. There was no correlation between somatostatin receptor expression and clinical response [87]. A prospective, phase 2 study, analyzed the efficacy of lanreotide 120 mg subcutaneously every 28 days in 35 patients with metastatic/locally advanced MCC [92]. The study failed to reach predefined criteria of efficacy, namely a success rate of more than 20% at 3 months, and data analysis ended prematurely (NCT02351128) [92]. Lutetium-177-DOTATATE, a peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, can deliver radiation to tumor cells expressing the somatostatin receptor and is currently tested in metastatic MCC alone or in combination with avelumab (NCT04276597, NCT04261855).  PI3K/mTOR InhibitorsStudies of genotypic profiling of MCC tumors identified a relatively low prevalence of activating somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene (7 out of 60 samples) [89]. MCPyV-positivity and PIK3CA mutations seemed to be mutually exclusive [93]. In a MCC cell line, the targeted inhibition of PI3KCA-activating mutations resulted in increased apoptosis [93]. A patient with PIK3CA-mutated metastatic MCC achieved a complete remission at 3 months of idelalisib treatment, a selective PI3KŒ¥ inhibitor [94]. PI3K pathway activation could drive tumorigenesis in a subset of MCC tumors and could be explored in future clinical trials.  DomatinostatDomatinostat, an enzyme histone deacetylase inhibitor, is evaluated in combination with avelumab in patients with advanced MCC progressing under anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (NCT04393753). One of the immune-escape mechanisms of MCC is the downregulation of MHC class I surface expression [95,96]. Histone deacetylase inhibitors have been shown to reverse low MHC class I expression epigenetically and restore tumor cell recognition and elimination by cytotoxic T cells [95].  Immune-Based StrategiesIntralesional treatments:Current translational and clinical evidence support the emerging role of intralesional therapies as direct modifiers of the tumor microenvironment in MCC [97,98,99]. Intra-tumoral delivery of IFNb in MCC has been shown to upregulate MHC class I expression, restoring antigen presentation [96]. Intralesional interleukin-12 or toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists such as TLR-4 agonist and G100 have been used with promising results [97,98,99], and TLR-9 (CMP-001) and TLR-7/8 (NKTR-262) agonists are currently evaluated alone or synergistically with anti-PD-1 for metastatic MCC (NCT04916002, NCT03435640).Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is commercially available for advanced melanoma. T-VEC is an oncolytic herpes virus, administered intratumorally, that replicates selectively within tumors with reported efficacy in a case series of patients with in-transit or locoregional MCC metastasis [100]. Phase 1/2 studies are currently evaluating T-VEC for the treatment of MCC alone (NCT03458117), with hypofractionated radiotherapy (NCT02819843), or with nivolumab (NCT02978625). RP1, another genetically modified herpes simplex 1 virus, is currently tested in organ transplant recipients with advanced MCC (NCT04349436). Localized oncolytic virotherapy can have an abscopal effect on distant non-injected lesions and could help overcome systemic tumor resistance to ICI [96].Therapeutic vaccines:Immunogenic epitopes clustered along the sequences of LT, ST, and VP1 have been expanded in MCPyV-positive MCCs [29,101]. Therapeutic vaccines targeting MCPyV-LT (ITI-3000) and VP1 antigens have mounted antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and prevented tumor recurrence in mice models [102,103]. A phase 1 clinical trial with ITI-3000 in the adjuvant setting is planned, with the main objective being the reduction of recurrences without significant toxicities. IFx-Hu2.0 is a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding for an immunogenic streptococcal membrane protein, Emm55, expressed by tumor cells after intra-tumoral injection. A phase I trial with IFx-Hu2.0 monotherapy (NCT04160065) and an EAP are currently available for patients with advanced/refractory MCC (NCT04853602). PD-1 blockade with simultaneous, but not sequential, T cell antigen priming with cancer vaccines could help reverse anti-PD-1 resistance [104].Adoptive cell therapy:Adoptive cell therapy with TIL or gene-modified T cells expressing novel TCR or chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) has proven particularly effective, especially against virus-driven malignancies. A phase 1/2 trial compared avelumab and interleukin-2 with (n = 1, group 1) and without (n = 7, group 2) infusions of HLA-restricted, MCPyV-T antigen-specific, polyclonal, autologous CD8+ T cells after tumor conditioning with radiotherapy or intra-tumoral IFNb (NCT02584829). After 1 year, 1 patient in group 1 and 4 patients in group 2 presented objective responses [105]. A promising future perspective for allogeneic adoptive T-cell transfer regardless of the HLA genotype arises from the recent expansion of MCPyV-T antigen-specific T cells from healthy donors [106]. A phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluates the efficacy of CAR T cells targeting glypican-3 (GPC3+), an oncofetal tumor antigen, and co-expressing exogenous GOT2, a mitochondrial enzyme in glutamine metabolism that contributes to cellular redox balance in metastatic, GPC3+ MCC (NCT05120271). Adoptive T cell therapies can be limited by the activation of immune-escape strategies by the tumor, namely the downregulation of the MHC class I molecules, significant toxicity (cytokine release syndrome in CAR T cell therapy), and manufacturing difficulties. Adoptive cell transfer of activated autologous or allogeneic NK cells can overcome these limitations and is under investigation in clinical trials for metastatic MCC (NCT03228667, NCCT03841110, NCT05069935, NCT02465957).Next-generation immune checkpoint inhibitors:Apart from PD-1 and CTLA-4, a variety of stimulatory and inhibitory coreceptors can regulate T cell activation and serve as potential drug targets. Next-generation co-inhibitory receptors blockade with anti-lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), anti-T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3), and anti-T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) antibodies are evaluated either as single agents or in association with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in several malignancies, including MCC (NCT03538028, NCT03652077, NCT03628677). Accordingly, immunotherapies that activate costimulatory receptors of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily on T cells such as OX-40 and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR) can enhance T cell differentiation and cytolytic functions and could have clinical implications in the management of metastatic MCC (NCT03071757, NCT03126110) [107].  7. ConclusionsThe era of immunotherapy and ICI has revolutionized the treatment paradigm of locally advanced/metastatic MCC. However, primary and acquired resistance or contraindication to ICI are relevant issues for a significant subset of patients, highlighting the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. Chemotherapy is currently considered to have a palliative role, and responses, when present, are short-lived. The great diversity in the oncogenesis of MCC can explain the failure to identify tumor-specific driver mutations in most patients and the limited efficacy of targeted therapies as monotherapy. Current research priorities aim to improve the responsiveness to immunotherapy by activating immune-negligent tumors and focus on the tumor microenvironment and on combination strategies between ‚Äúclassic‚Äù ICI and next-generation ICI, radiotherapy, targeted therapies, intra-tumoral vaccines, and adoptive cell therapy. Other key questions that will hopefully be addressed in the near future are the appropriate treatment duration and dosage of anti-PD-/PD-L1 inhibitors among responders and the identification of predictive biomarkers of sensitivity to ICI.

AbstractBackgroundMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin caused by either the integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) and expression of viral T antigens or by ultraviolet-induced damage to the tumor genome from excessive sunlight exposure. An increasing number of deep sequencing studies of MCC have identified significant differences between the number and types of point mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variants between virus-positive and virus-negative tumors. However, it has been challenging to reliably distinguish between virus positive and UV damaged MCC.MethodsIn this study, we assembled a cohort of 71 MCC patients and performed deep sequencing with OncoPanel, a clinically implemented, next-generation sequencing assay targeting over 400 cancer-associated genes. To improve the accuracy and sensitivity for virus detection compared to traditional PCR and IHC methods, we developed a hybrid capture baitset against the entire MCPyV genome and software to detect integration sites and structure.ResultsSequencing from this approach revealed distinct integration junctions in the tumor genome and generated assemblies that strongly support a model of microhomology-initiated hybrid, virus-host, circular DNA intermediate that promotes focal amplification of host and viral DNA. Using the clear delineation between virus-positive and virus-negative tumors from this method, we identified recurrent somatic alterations common across MCC and alterations specific to each class of tumor, associated with differences in overall survival. Finally, comparing the molecular and clinical data from these patients revealed a surprising association of immunosuppression with virus-negative MCC and significantly shortened overall survival.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate the value of high-confidence virus detection for identifying molecular mechanisms of UV and viral oncogenesis in MCC. Furthermore, integrating these data with clinical data revealed features that could impact patient outcome and improve our understanding of MCC risk factors.
BackgroundMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. Risk factors for developing MCC include advanced age, light skin color with excessive sunlight exposure, and a variety of immunocompromised conditions [1]. In 2008, Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) was first detected by Southern blot in some but not all MCC tumors with integration of viral DNA occurring at several different chromosomal sites. Importantly, an identical clonal integration pattern was detected in one primary tumor and corresponding metastatic lymph node [2]. This important insight implied that integration of the viral DNA was an early if not initiating event in virus-positive MCC oncogenesis. MCPyV infects most people, typically at an early age, and results in an asymptomatic and lifelong infection indicated by the persistent presence of antibodies to the viral coat protein VP1 [3, 4]. Although MCPyV DNA can be readily detected on the skin, the cell types where the virus replicates in vivo have not been determined [5].Since the original discovery of MCPyV, it has become increasingly clear that virus-positive MCC has a different etiology than virus-negative, UV-associated, MCC [1]. Virus-positive MCC expresses the viral oncogenes large T antigen (LT) and small T antigen (ST) and the tumor genome usually contains very few mutations in cellular oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. In contrast, studies using whole exome or targeted hybrid capture sequencing have revealed that virus-negative MCC has an exceptionally high somatic mutation load predominated by UV-mediated mutations with frequent mutations in RB1, TP53, NOTCH1, and FAT1 [6, 7]. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of MCC confirmed virus-positive MCC exhibits a globally lower, non-UV-mediated, mutation burden as well as few somatic copy number amplifications, deletions, and rearrangements compared to virus-negative MCC, while providing new insights into the structure and mechanism of virus integration [8].Accurate detection of the presence of MCPyV and distinguishing between virus-positive and virus-negative MCC is important for insight into the oncogenesis, cell-of-origin, and therapeutic options. Currently, there is no routine clinical effort to distinguish between virus-positive MCC and virus-negative MCC. Several recent studies have suggested differences between virus-positive MCC and virus-negative MCC in presentation, age, and response to immunotherapy [9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. However, current techniques for determining viral status have yielded either inaccurate or ambiguous results. Although WGS provides much more genetic information on the tumor and viral genome compared to targeted approaches, it remains impractical for clinical evaluation of MCC.The most common methods for detection of MCPyV in MCC include PCR amplification of MCPyV DNA from DNA isolated from MCC tumors or immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for MCPyV LT using monoclonal antibodies CM2B4 and Ab3 [16, 17]. However, both PCR and IHC have been shown to be unreliable in distinguishing between virus-positive from virus-negative MCC. For example, a recent study of 282 cases of MCC evaluated virus positivity by IHC with monoclonal antibodies CM2B4 and Ab3 or by PCR with a previously validated primer set [18]. Notably, there was concordance for all three assays in only 167 of 282 (59.2%) cases with an additional 62 cases positive for two of the three tests. The remaining 53 (18.8%) were positive for one test or none. This study assigned the MCC to be virus-positive if two or three tests were positive, implying that detection of viral DNA by PCR alone was not sufficient for a tumor to be called virus-positive MCC. Furthermore, because of the sensitivity of PCR in detecting DNA, a lower limit of 0.01 copy of MCPyV DNA per tumor cell was called virus-positive MCC. Tumors containing <‚Äâ0.01 viral copies/cell were called virus-negative. A different study using RNA-ISH to detect mRNA specific for MCPyV LT and ST found this method to be as sensitive as qPCR when using two primer sets and the viral copy number was set to >‚Äâ0.004/cell [19]. The AMERCK test detects circulating antibodies against the MCPyV ST [20]. The sensitivity of this test is low for detection of virus-positive MCC but, when positive, can be used as a biomarker for disease status [20].The high somatic mutation burden in virus-negative MCC is predicted to yield more tumor neoantigens than melanomas or non-small cell lung cancers (median of 173, 65, and 111 neoantigens/sample, respectively) [21] [22]. As observed for other tumor types, the high neoantigen burden in virus-negative MCC corresponds to a higher degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in some tumors, but these tumors also express PD-L1 rendering these lymphocytes ineffective [7]. Despite the numerous observed differences in mutation rate and number of predicted neoantigens, both virus-positive MCC and virus-negative MCC tumors have shown high response rates to PD-L1 and PD1 checkpoint blockade therapy [14, 15].For further advancements to be made in understanding MCC, especially for patients not responsive to current therapies, clear and accurate determination of the MCPyV virus status and actionable variants in these tumors are required. In this study, we developed a viral hybrid capture next-generation sequencing (NGS) method to detect the presence of integrated MCPyV DNA in FFPE clinical specimens for routine use in a clinical setting. This approach was combined with targeted sequencing of several hundred cancer-related genes to assess oncogenic changes in the tumor genome. Lastly, we compared the sensitivity and accuracy of this viral hybrid capture approach to more traditional approaches, PCR detection of viral DNA, IHC for detection of MCPyV LT, and synoptic assessment of MCC pathology.MethodsStudy design and participantsThis study included all patients (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ71) with a reported diagnosis of MCC at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women‚Äôs Cancer Center who underwent comprehensive genomic profiling by OncoPanel between May 2013 and April 2018. OncoPanel version 3 (POPv3) is a custom hybrid capture assay targeting the exons of 447 genes and 191 regions across 60 genes commonly rearranged in cancer [23, 24]. A retrospective chart review collected demographic, clinical, disease, treatment, and outcome variables on all 71 patients. For 40 patients, sufficient DNA remained from the initial OncoPanel profiling or from additional FFPE tumor specimens to perform POPv3/ViroPanel. When available, FFPE sections were sectioned for immunohistochemistry with antibodies CM2B4 and Ab3 [17]. Sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin were evaluated by synoptic review [25].Nucleic acid isolation, library preparation and sequencingTo perform ViroPanel with and without supplementation with the OncoPanel (v3) bait set, purified DNA was quantified using a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay (Thermo Fisher). Library construction was performed using 200‚Äâng of DNA, which was first fragmented to ~‚Äâ250‚Äâbp using a Covaris LE220 Focused ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA) followed by size-selected cleanup using Agencourt AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc. Indianapolis, IN) at a 1:1 bead to sample ratio. Fragmented DNA was converted to Illumina libraries using a KAPA HTP library kit using the manufacturer‚Äôs recommendations (Thermo Fisher). Adapter ligation was done using xGen dual index UMI adapters (IDT, Coralville, IA).Samples were pooled in equal volume and run on an Illumina MiSeq nano flow cell to quantitate the amount of library based on the number of reads per barcode. All samples yielded sufficient library (>‚Äâ250‚Äâng) and were taken forward into hybrid capture. Libraries were pooled at equal mass (3‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ17-plex and 1‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ18-plex) to a total of 750‚Äâng. Captures were done using the SureSelectXT Fast target enrichment assay (Agilent, Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with ViroPanel with and without supplementation with the OncoPanel (v3) bait set. Captures were sequenced on an Illumina 2500 in rapid run mode (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA).Sequence alignment and somatic variant callingPooled samples were de-multiplexed and sorted using Illumina‚Äôs bcl2fastq software (v2.17). Reads were aligned to the reference sequence b37 edition from the Human Genome Reference Consortium as well as viral genomes targeted by the Virus Capture Baitset v2 using bwa mem (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml) [26]. The viral genomes and human genome were combined into one alignment reference so reads could map to the closest matching reference sequence.Duplicate reads were identified using unique molecular indices (UMIs) and marked using the Picard tools. The alignments were further refined using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) for localized realignment around indel sites and base quality score recalibration [27, 28].Mutation analysis for single nucleotide variants (SNV) was performed using MuTect v1.1.4 (CEPH control was used as the ‚Äúproject normal‚Äù) and annotated by Variant Effect Predictor v 79 (VEP) [29, 30]. We used the SomaticIndelDetector tool that is part of the GATK for indel calling. After initial identification of SNVs and indels by MuTect and GATK respectively, the variants were annotated using OncoAnnotate to determine what genes were impacted and their effect on the amino acid sequence. OncoAnnotate also applied additional filters using the Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) and gnomAD datasets to flag common SNPs.Variants that affect protein coding regions underwent further filtering/classification based on frequency in the gnomAD, ESP, and COSMIC (version 80) databases. If the frequency of the variant was less than or equal to 1% in all gnomAD and ESP populations, the variant was flagged as ‚ÄúREVIEW_REQUIRED‚Äù. If the frequency of the variant was greater than 1% and less than or equal to 10% in all gnomAD and ESP populations and present in ‚ÄúCOSMIC‚Äù database at least two times, the variant was flagged as ‚ÄúREVIEW_REQUIRED‚Äù. If the frequency of the variant was between 1% and less than or equal to 10% in all gnomAD and ESP populations and not present in ‚ÄúCOSMIC‚Äù database at least two times, the variant is flagged as ‚ÄúNO_REVIEW_GERMLINE_FILTER‚Äù. If the frequency of the variant was greater than 10% in any gnomAD and ESP populations, the variant was flagged as ‚ÄúNO_REVIEW_GERMLINE_FILTER‚Äù. Variants with a frequency greater than 10% in any gnomAD or ESP population were considered to be a common SNP irrespective of presence in the COSMIC database.Variants in the viral genomes were called using samtools mpileup and bcftools from the aligned bam files. Called variants were filtered to have a minimum coverage of 5 reads and minimum allele frequency of 1% of total reads covering that base in a single sample. Variants were annotated based on the NC_010277.2 reference sequence in GenBank using SnpEff [31].Recurrent copy number analysisCopy number variant calling was performed using a combination of VisCap Cancer and CNVkit as previously described [32, 33]. All resulting gene copy number variants from all patients were compared against each other with UV status and significant mutual exclusivity/co-occurrence was calculated using Fisher‚Äôs exact test corrected by FDR for multiple comparisons in the R statistical environment. Using the network and iGraphs packages the significantly co-occurrent variants were clustered into networks. The genes belonging to each distinct network cluster with more than five member genes were then labeled and extracted. Using these gene lists as cluster definitions, each patient was evaluated for presence or absence of each CNV cluster. Presence of a CNV cluster was determined if more than 50% of the member genes of that cluster were modified in the same patient. Copy number variants from TCGA were retrieved from cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal.org/) and plotted using ggplot2 in the R statistical environment [34, 35].Viral integration analysisA custom perl script was written to extract, assemble, annotate, and visualize viral reads and determine viral integration sites. Viral reads and their mates were first identified and extracted by those that have at least one mate map to the viral genome. Additional reads containing viral sequence were identified by a bloom filter constructed of unique, overlapping 31‚Äâbp‚Äâk-mers of the MCPyV genome [36]. The human genome positions for any read with a mate mapping to the viral genome were output into a bed file and the orientation of viral and human pairs was stored to accurately deconvolute overlapping integration sites. This bed file was then merged down into overlapping ranges based on orientation counting the number of reads overlapping that range. Skewdness in coverage of integration junctions was calculated by the difference in the fraction of virus-host read pairs overlapping the first and second halves of the aforementioned ranges. This skewdness value was used to determine the orientation of the viral-host junction (i.e., positive values, junction is on the 3‚Ä≤ end of the range; negative values, junction is on the 5‚Ä≤ end of the range), which was validated from the results of de novo assembly. Integrated viral genomes were assembled from extracted reads using SPAdes with default parameters [37]. The assembly graphs from SPAdes were annotated using blastn against hg19 and the MCPyV reference genome with an e-value cutoff of 1‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí‚Äâ10. Annotated assembly graphs were visualized using the ggraph R package.Integrations sites confirmed by reference guided alignment and assembly data were analyzed for stretches of microhomology between the human and viral genomes by selecting 10‚Äâbp upstream and downstream of the integration junction on the viral and human genomes. Within these sequences stretches of identical sequence at the same position longer than two base pairs were counted. Overall homology between the sequences was calculated by Levenshtein distance. Three integration junctions with indeterminate DNA sequence ranging from 1 to 25‚Äâbp inserted between viral and human DNA were excluded from analysis. Expected microhomology was calculated by randomly selecting 1000 20‚Äâbp pairs of non-N containing sequence from the human and MCPyV genomes.Integration site proximity to repeat elements were determined using bedtools closest and repeatmasker annotations acquired from the UCSC genome browser [38]. Expected frequency of integration near repeat elements was determined by randomly selecting 1000 sites in the human genome. Sites within 2‚Äâkb of a repeat element were counted as close proximity.Functional annotation of somatic mutations and viral integration events was performed using PANTHER (www.pantherdb.org) [39].StatisticsThe association between relapse and genomic characteristics are tested with Fisher‚Äôs exact test using all patient sequencing data regardless of primary or recurrence biopsy. Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from initial diagnosis to death, and patients who did not die are censored at the last follow-up date. The 95% confidence intervals of the median OS times are estimated using log(‚àílog(OS)) methodology. Statistical significance is defined as p‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ0.05.Associations between recurrent CNV, TMB, or viral copies and overall survival were calculated and graphed using GraphPad Prism 7. Fisher‚Äôs exact test and Kaplan-Meier curves were computed with the R statistical environment. Significant enrichment of microhomology and repeat elements at integrations sites was determined using Fisher‚Äôs exact test between observed and expected events.Human subjectsThis study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles and approved by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute institutional review board. Written informed consent was received from participants prior to inclusion in the study.ResultsSummary of patient cohortA total of 71 patients diagnosed with MCC were included in this study (Table¬†1). The median (95% CI) follow-up duration from initial diagnosis of MCC was 47 (95% CI: 38‚Äì60) months based on inverse Kaplan-Meier estimation. Overall, 69 enrolled patients were white and two were black. Forty (56%) patients were male. The median age was 70‚Äâyears (range <‚Äâ50 to 93). The initial site of MCC presentation was in the head and neck (27%), upper extremity (20%), lower extremity (21%), and trunk (32%). The seventh edition TNM staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) was used to classify the initial presentation of MCC with 27% presenting at stage I, 14% stage II, 42% stage III, and 17% stage IV.
Table 1 Patient characteristics (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ71)Full size tableSomatic variant analysis of targeted sequencingAll 71 patients underwent OncoPanel analysis [32]. Genomic studies were performed using DNA isolated from tumors obtained at the time of initial diagnosis (n=50) or upon relapse (n=21). The total number of mutations ranged from 0 to 73 corresponding to a tumor mutational burden (TMB; mutations/megabase) from 0 to 38.89 with four cases containing no detectable mutations (Fig.¬†1a, Additional¬†file¬†1: Table S1). From this mutation data, patients were binned into TMB-high (‚â•‚Äâ20), TMB-intermediate (>‚Äâ6‚Äâ<‚Äâ20), and TMB-low (‚â§‚Äâ6). A limited set of mutation signatures could be identified (see ‚ÄúMethods‚Äù). The UV mutational signature (Signature 7) was detected in 24 cases, corresponding to the TMB-high patients [40]. Additional mutational signatures identified included Aging (Signature 1; 3 cases), APOBEC (Signatures 2 and 13; 4 cases with 3 that also had an UV signature), and Signature 5 (one case) (Fig.¬†1a, Additional¬†file¬†1: Table S1). TMB had some correlation with the number of copy number altered genes (Fig.¬†1b). Several genes including RB1, TP53, KMT2D, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and FAT1 were highly enriched for missense and truncating mutations (Fig.¬†1c, Additional¬†file¬†2: Fig. S1). Single and dinucleotide substitutions in RB1 and TP53 revealed that most were likely mediated by UV damage (CC‚Äâ>‚ÄâTT, C‚Äâ>‚ÄâT; Fig.¬†1d).

Functional domains of p53 and pRB are highlighted by colored boxes. Each type of base substitution is highlight by a different color lollipop and nonsense mutations are indicated by asterisksFull size imageCopy number variants (CNVs) were examined individually as well as against each other and other likely functional somatic changes for significant co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity (Additional¬†file¬†1: Table S2). Clusters of significantly co-occurrent CNVs were determined via network analysis (Fig.¬†2a, Additional¬†file¬†2: Fig. S2 & Fig. S3). From these analyses, two distinct CNV clusters were each found to be altered in more than 36% of cases (Fig.¬†2b, c). Chromosome 10 (cluster 14) had frequent copy number loss with 26 tumors showing heterozygous or homozygous loss of the chromosome (Fig.¬†2b) [41]. Some cancer-relevant genes on chromosome 10 include PTEN and SUFU, negative regulators of PI3K and Hedgehog signaling respectively, with deletions reported in prior studies of MCC [41, 42]. A region of Chr1q (cluster 13) was amplified in 28 cases. This region includes MDM4 (also known as MDMX), whose protein product cooperates with MDM2 to promote the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53 (Fig. 2b) [43, 44]. In addition, we observed a focal amplification of MYCL within a greater amplification of Chr1p (cluster 4), which was reported in an earlier study of MCC [45].

Six other CNV clusters were strongly associated with UV signature and high TMB (Fig.¬†2c). Functional annotation of the clusters revealed that the two largest UV-associated CNV clusters (1 and 3) had significant enrichment for genes related broadly to DNA damage response and S-phase DNA damage checkpoint likely enhancing tolerance for UV mutagenesis.Cluster 5, corresponding to 6p22.3 to 6q26 and likely representing a gain of the entire chromosome 6, was the only cluster more than twice as frequent in TMB-low tumors than TMB-high tumors (Fig.¬†2c). Interestingly, 33.3% (6/18) of metastatic tumors carried cluster 5 and all but one of these metastatic tumors were TMB-low MCC. Furthermore, CNV cluster 5 was 2.5 times more frequent in TMB-low (25%, 11/44) than TMB-high (11%, 2/18) tumors in primary tumors. Both TMB-low and TMB-high patients with amplification of CNV cluster 5 had significantly improved overall survival compared to wild type carrying patients (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.005). Restricting this analysis to only primary tumors, revealed that there were no deaths at the time of this study in patients carrying this amplification (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.007) (Fig.¬†2d, e). Unsurprisingly, considering the prevalence of this CNV event in metastatic patients, there was no difference in recurrence-free survival (RFS, Additional¬†file¬†2: Fig. S4).The recurrent copy number events on chromosomes 1, 6, and 10 were compared within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for similarities to other tumor types (Fig.¬†2f‚Äìh). This analysis revealed that the chromosome 1 (cluster 13) amplification was also frequently observed in ovarian, breast, and bladder cancers, whereas the chromosome 10 (cluster 14) loss was most frequently seen in prostate cancer. Gain of chromosome 6 (cluster 5) was most frequently seen in ovarian, bladder, and esophago-gastric cancers.Analysis of viral sequences in tumorsOf the 71 tumors analyzed by OncoPanel, 48 with sufficient remaining material were re-analyzed by OncoPanel (Profile/OncoPanel version 3, POPv3) combined with a hybrid-capture probe bait set targeting the entire genome of MCPyV and other known oncogenic viruses (ViroPanel). For the 48 cases, the number of MCPyV reads ranged from 0 to 21,095,751 with only a single case having zero MCPyV reads (Fig.¬†3a). In total, 28 cases had substantial reads (>‚Äâ6800) mapping to the MCPyV genome that also supported integration of the virus into the host genome through reads and read pairs that span integration junctions. For the remaining 20 cases without evidence of integration, the number of viral reads ranged from 0 to 971. Generally, these cases had reads that covered less than 10% of the viral genome with the normalized coverage less than two logs compared to samples with evidence for virus integration (Fig.¬†3b, c). Concordantly, the viral reads from most of these cases were unable to be assembled into larger viral contigs. Two cases, MCC011 and MCC015, had 212 and 177 MCPyV reads that could be assembled into nine and five contigs each smaller than 761 base pairs, respectively. Case MCC007 had the most reads of any likely virus-negative sample and could be assembled into a single 5343‚Äâbp contig. However, analysis of the point and deletion variants in these aforementioned viral contigs revealed that they were identical to the virus sequence from patient MCC037 indicating that the viral reads resulted from low-level contamination (<‚Äâ0.005% of MCC037 MCPyV reads were detected in other samples).

Consistent with previous reports, the integrated viral genome had undergone extensive mutagenesis with large deletions (>‚Äâ100‚Äâbp) particularly in the 3‚Ä≤ half of LT as well as in the viral coat protein genes VP1 and VP2 (Fig.¬†4). In 10 cases, approximately half of the total viral genome was deleted, 6 cases had approximately 25% of the viral genome deleted, while 12 cases had sequences corresponding to the entire or nearly complete genome (Figs.¬†3c and 4). In all but one of the cases with a nearly complete coverage of the viral genome, there was a clonal point mutation which inserted a premature stop codon in LT resulting in truncated proteins between 208 and 771 amino acids (Fig.¬†5a) similar to what has previously been seen in MCC cell lines and clinical cohorts. In a single case (MCC054), LT was truncated by a 5-bp deletion resulting in a frame shift that introduced a premature stop codon in frame. In all cases, the non-coding control region, the N-terminal 208 residues of LT, and an intact ST region of the viral genome were conserved.

In stark contrast, ST only had missense mutations at three residues, and the amino acid change A20S is consistent with a previously observed MCPyV strain difference (GenBank identical protein accession number: ACI25295.1). The other missense mutations occurred clonally at H41Y and N100S once in the entire cohort (Fig.¬†5b). Neither of these mutations are present in any of the ST sequences in GenBank and have not been previously reported.The integration sites were mapped using the oncovirus tools suite (https://github.com/gstarrett/oncovirus_tools) (Fig.¬†6a, Table¬†2) [46]. As previously reported, integrations primarily fell into two categories: either those that appear as a single integration event or as two events separated by >‚Äâ10 kilobases (kb) [8]. Interestingly, two cases had integration events in non-identical but overlapping sites in chromosome 1 (Fig.¬†6b). These represent the first reported cases of recurrent viral integration sites in MCC.

P values from Fisher‚Äôs exact test are represented above the barsFull size imageTable 2 MCPyV integration sitesFull size tableBased on previous MCC WGS, MCPyV integration sites frequently coincide with focal amplifications in the human genome. We can therefore infer that the regions between distant (>‚Äâ10‚Äâkb) viral integration sites were amplified; however, no targeted exon were within these regions [8]. Because of the limited number of capture targets sequence by the OncoPanel platform, determining the exact boundaries of the expected virus-mediated amplifications in cases with junctions <‚Äâ10‚Äâkb apart was not possible. However, using the normalized viral coverage, the estimated number of viral genome copies ranged between 1 and 1881 copies (median: 7, interquartile range (IQR) 4‚Äì13) (Table¬†2). When annotating these regions, we observed that they frequently contain enhancer regions that may contribute to oncogenesis as seen in HPV-associated tumors [47]. Uniquely, patient MCC026 had integrations in chromosomes 9, 16, and 18, all of which had integration sites separated by between 107.5 and 129.9¬†kbp appearing to be distinct events.Using automated computational methods, we could not confidently determine an integration site for case MCC037 with the highest viral genome copy number in this study. Manually interrogating the human sequence hits from the assembly revealed that it matched a tandem repeat sequence flanked by MLT1H2 ERVL-MaLR elements. Based on the estimated copy number and the assembly graph, the viral component of this fusion DNA structure is likely larger than 10¬†Mbp (Additional¬†file¬†3: Fig. S6).With the high depth of coverage facilitated by the targeted NGS method, high-resolution assemblies for the integrated virus were generated. Many integrations that appeared as a single linear contig contained a single copy of the viral genome flanked by the host genome (Fig.¬†6c, Additional¬†file¬†3: Fig. S6). However, other integrations generated more complex assembly graphs with a multiple contigs linked together in a ‚Äúpigtails‚Äù conformation (Fig.¬†6d, Additional¬†file¬†3: Fig. S6). Based on coverage and conformation, this graph likely represents an integration event containing partially duplicated viral genome concatemers fused to different segments of the human genome. For samples with distant integration sites, the directionality of the virus-host junctions strongly supports a circular virus-host DNA fusion intermediate prior to reintegration into the host chromosome. This model is further supported by assemblies in which one arm of the fusion contains sequences from both distant sites of the human genome (Fig.¬†6e, Additional¬†file¬†3: Fig. S6).To address a possible mechanism for integration, we looked for microhomology between the human and MCPyV genomes at fusion junctions. We found significant enrichment for 4, 5, and 7‚Äâbp sequence microhomology at the site of integration compared to randomly selected sites in the human and MCPyV genomes (Fig.¬†6f). There was no significant increase in overall homology between MCPyV and human DNA at integration sites versus randomly selected sites. Patient MCC027 had the integration site with the longest stretch of homology, and MCC041 had both the integration site with the greatest overall homology on its 3‚Ä≤ end and lowest homology with no microhomology greater than 1‚Äâbp on its 5‚Ä≤ end (Fig.¬†6g). Additionally, we annotated integration sites for proximity to repeat elements, including LINEs, SINEs, LTR retrotransposons, and simple repeats in the human genome. No type of repeat element was significantly enriched, but all integration sites were within 1.5‚Äâkb of a repeat element and there was a trend towards integrations near LTR retrotransposons and low-complexity regions (Fig.¬†6h).Distinguishing virus-positive MCC from virus-negative MCC using somatic variants in comparison to immunohistochemistry and PCRGiven the striking differences in the number of mutations and mutational signature we observed in the ViroPanel dataset that strongly correlated with virus integration, we compared the data from the OncoPanel and POPv3/ViroPanel datasets to determine the viral status of all 71 tumors studied (Table¬†3). From the OncoPanel sequencing, we identified off-target reads for MCPyV in a total of 18/71 cases, ranging from 1 to 194 reads total. When compared to the ViroPanel data, there was a rough correlation between the number of off-target reads and the number of MCPyV reads in the ViroPanel dataset. There were 8 samples with MCPyV reads in the OncoPanel dataset that were not also analyzed by ViroPanel. None of these 8 cases have any evidence for a UV mutational signature.
Table 3 Comparison of sequencing, PCR, and IHC for determination of tumor viral statusFull size tableWe assessed the total number of mutations, TMB, UV signature, and detection of MCPyV reads to characterize each tumor as either virus-positive MCC or virus-negative MCC. Using these criteria, we called 25 tumors as virus-negative. All but one of the virus-negative MCC tumors had a UV mutational signature and had higher number of total mutations (18‚Äì73), higher TMB, and absence of integrated MCPyV compared to virus-positive MCC. The virus-negative MCC without a UV signature (MCC007) originally presented as a subcutaneous breast mass [48]. A total of 46 MCC tumors of the 71 analyzed were characterized as virus-positive. These virus-positive MCC had an absence of UV mutational signature, a lower number of total mutations (0‚Äì16), and lower TMB than did any of the virus-negative MCC. The TMB-low and -high categories had perfect concordance with virus-positive and virus-negative MCC determined by sequencing, respectively. The TMB-intermediate samples were mostly virus-negative (7/9), but the lowest two TMB patients in this category are likely virus-positive based on ViroPanel sequencing and absence of UV mutation signature.FFPE sections were available for 28 of the 71 cases to assess for MCPyV LT by IHC with antibodies CM2B4 and Ab3. For 8 of the virus-negative MCC, all were negative by IHC with both antibodies. For 20 virus-positive MCC cases, we observed 16 stained positive with both antibodies and 4 were negative (Table¬†3). In addition, DNA was tested by PCR with 5 primer sets for 15 cases. In 9 virus-positive MCC cases, all returned positive results with 2 to 5 primer sets (Table¬†3). For 6 virus-negative cases, PCR was negative for 5 primer sets and one was positive with one primer set. Interestingly, the virus-negative MCC (MCC007) with one PCR primer set positive also ranked at the TMB borderline (9.58) between virus-negative and virus-positive and did not score as having a UV mutational signature; rather, the majority of mutations were classified as APOBEC-associated.A synoptic review of dermatopathology was available for 19 cases (Additional file 1: Table S4) [25]. Criteria evaluated included procedure, site, size (mm), thickness (mm), lymphovascular invasion, tumor extension, mitotic rate, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), growth pattern, neurotropism, and necrosis (%). TILS were largely absent in both virus-positive and virus-negative samples. An infiltrative growth pattern was observed in virus-positive MCC and nodular or nodular infiltrative observed in both forms of MCC. Neurotropism was present in three cases of virus-positive MCC and necrosis which ranged from 0 to 40%.Statistical comparison of clinical and molecular characteristicsOverall, 28 patients remained disease free after initial therapy and 43 developed one or more relapses or persisted as stage IV (Additional file 2: Fig. S5). According to the biopsy type and first relapse status, patients could be grouped into primary biopsy with no further recurrence (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ30), primary biopsy with further recurrence (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ22), and recurrence biopsy (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ19). For all biopsies annotated as a recurrence, the first recurrence occurred before the biopsy was obtained. Among the 19 recurrence biopsies, 15 were distant metastatic biopsies, one local recurrence (MCC027), one unspecified recurrence (MCC063), one second recurrence (MCC057), and one local recurrence with no prior chemo/XRT (MCC026). Regardless of the biopsy type, all patients and sequencing data were grouped into either no relapse (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ30) or relapse (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ41). Table¬†4 shows the association between relapse and genomic characteristics. Among 71 patients, 30 (42.3%) patients had no relapse and 41 (57.7%) had relapse after initial diagnosis. From Fisher‚Äôs exact test results, UV, RB1 status, TP53 status, and virus status were all not significantly associated with relapse (Table¬†4). If the OncoPanel data obtained after relapse (and prior treatment) was excluded and restricted to the 52 patients with primary biopsy, UV, RB1 status, TP53 status, and virus status were all not significantly associated with relapse (Additional file 1: Table S5).
Table 4 Association between relapse and genomic sequencing (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ71)Full size tableConsistent with known risk factors of MCC, 10 of the 71 cases had immunosuppression diagnosed prior to developing MCC. Remarkably, 8 of the 10 (80%) of the immunosuppressed cases were identified as virus-negative MCC with relatively high TMB compared to the 28% virus-negative MCC in immunocompetent patients (Fig.¬†7a, Table¬†5). Virus-negative MCC was present in three patients with solid organ transplantation; three with autoimmune diseases including myasthenia gravis, rheumatoid arthritis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis; one with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS); and another with Waldenstrom‚Äôs macroglobulinemia. In contrast, virus-positive MCC was identified in a patient with mantle zone lymphoma having been treated with Rituximab for 3‚Äâyears and another with germline mutations in NF1 and GATA2 [49]. The median OS for patients with immunosuppression was 17.5‚Äâmonths (95% CI 5.6‚Äì24.4‚Äâmonths), significantly shorter than patients without immunosuppression (48.5‚Äâmonths, 95% CI 35.4‚Äì113.3‚Äâmonths, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01) (Fig.¬†7b, Table¬†5). Immunosuppressed patients also exhibited significantly shorter recurrence-free survival, 7.5‚Äâmonths (95% CI 3.5‚Äì20.1‚Äâmonths) and 20.2‚Äâmonths (95% CI 12.9‚Äì50.2‚Äâmonths, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01), respectively. We acknowledge that some cases have relatively short follow-up times that may impact survival analysis; however, the association of OS and immunosuppression only shifts slightly after keeping patients with follow-up times greater than 6‚Äâmonths (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ63) remaining statistically significant. Under this criterion, the median OS for immunocompetent and immunosuppressed cases were 48.5‚Äâmonths (95% CI 35.4 to 113.3‚Äâmonths) and 21.6‚Äâmonths (95% CI 6.9 to 30.7‚Äâmonths, p value <‚Äâ0.01), respectively.

We built upon an NGS platform that has been instituted as a routine part of clinical care at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital, and Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital. The viral hybrid capture assay, ViroPanel, acquired a high number of MCPyV reads for many samples. Importantly, evidence for specific integration was associated with all cases with a high number of reads (>‚Äâ6000). Spurious MCPyV reads were also detected in 19 of 20 MCC cases that were deemed to be virus-negative by TMB and UV mutations. There was no evidence for integration in these cases; rather, these reads could be traced to be extremely low-level contamination from MCC037 during library preparation or sequencing. In contrast, true virus-positive MCCs have low TMB with clear assemblies of virus-host junctions with MCC-hallmark deletions in the MCPyV genome.Integration sites were observed in 12 different chromosomes with the most occurring on chromosome 5. In addition, two fully overlapping integration sites from two different tumors were observed on chromosome 1 separated by only 10‚Äì20‚Äâkb. Based on the clonality of deletions and point mutations in the MCPyV genome, these events most likely occurred before or during integration as was similarly determined from another study on MCC cell lines [50]. For both MCPyV and HPV, it has previously been proposed that integration initiates after DNA double strand breaks in the host genome and viral genomes, likely during viral genome replication as integrated viral concatemers are common [8, 51]. In this study, we identified that integration is then likely mediated through erroneous DNA repair at sites of microhomology between the host and viral genomes. This is similar to mechanisms identified for microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) for HPV genome integration in tumors, but it has yet to be determined if the same host factors are involved [52]. For both MCPyV and HPV mediated tumors, the MMEJ event frequently leads to the formation of a transiently circular DNA intermediate, which can be amplified through aberrant firing of the viral origin of replication [53]. The resulting large linear DNA then reintegrates into the chromosome and appears as amplified regions of the host genome in a tandem head-to-tail conformation interspersed with the viral genome [8].Case MCC026 has three apparently separate integration events occurring on different chromosomes. The integration event on chromosome 16 only contains a small section of the viral genome from positions 2853‚Äì3521, which would only encode the helicase domain of LT and therefore is unlikely to contribute to tumor survival. Conversely, the event on chromosome 18 has a full copy of the viral genome while the event on chromosome 9 contains the NCCR, ST, and a truncated LT, likely sufficient to contribute to oncogenesis. Based on the assembly graphs and coverage, one or both of these integration events have more than one copy of ST and LT (Fig.¬†4 and Additional¬†file¬†3: Fig. S6). Distinct sequences derived during assembly and the distances between the intrachromosomal junctions (107‚Äì129kbp) indicate that these likely are separate events, but only long-read sequencing of this tumor can definitively determine that these are not part of a larger interchromosomal translocation.The most common chromosomal copy number changes involved chromosomes 1 and 10. Amplification of 1p (cluster 4) involving MYCL was observed more commonly in virus-negative cases, but was identified in a few virus-positive cases. Interestingly, in virus-positive MCC, MCPyV ST binds MYCL and the EP400 chromatin modifying complex to activate transcription of several hundred target genes [54]. Amplification of MYCL is likely to be an oncogenic event that contributes to MCC aggressiveness. Amplification of Chr1q (cluster 13) was also observed in both virus-positive and virus-negative MCC. This region includes MDM4, whose protein product cooperates with MDM2 to promote the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53 [43, 44]. There may be additional pro-oncogenic genes in this cluster that contribute to MCC oncogenesis when p53 is mutated. Heterozygous loss of chromosome 10 (cluster 14) was observed in 26/71 MCC including both virus-positive and virus-negative tumors. Loss of chromosome 10 likely reduces PTEN levels contributing to activation of the PI3K signaling pathway.A recurrent amplification of chromosome 6 has previously been observed for MCC; however, this observation predated the discovery of MCPyV and was not associated with morphology or outcome [55]. In other cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer, this amplification is typically associated with worse outcome [55]. Although the chromosome 6 amplification in this study was significantly associated with better overall survival, it was also more frequent in metastasis. This amplification contains genes such as VEGFA, which promotes angiogenesis and has been observed to be expressed at higher levels in distant ovarian cancer metastases [56]. Interestingly, further analysis of genes that are more abundantly mutated in the sequenced metastatic lesions, revealed statistically significant (q‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.47‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí‚Äâ7) pathway enrichment for angiogenesis as well as EGFR signaling and p53 dysregulation. FANCE is also carried on this chromosome and as a DNA damage response gene act to limit number of point mutations and copy number changes observed in virus-positive MCC, hindering tumor evolution. Together, this amplification co-occurring with MCPyV may represent a less fatal, but more metastatic subtype of MCC. Additionally, this result could be impacted by diagnosis, treatment, or study recruitment of metastatic MCC.Unexpectedly, we observed that 8 of 10 cases with immunosuppression were virus-negative MCC. While it was recognized in the early 1990s that individuals with hematologic malignancies that developed MCC had a poor prognosis [57], it was not until 1997 when a direct link between immunosuppression and MCC was postulated [58]. At that time, a correlation was noted between medically induced immunosuppression with azathioprine and cyclosporine and the development and rapid spread of MCC. Early reports highlighted a prolonged period of immunosuppression prior to MCC development. Notably, the search for a viral pathogen in MCC was initiated because of reports linking MCC with immunosuppression and with HIV-1/AIDS [2]. A subsequent report has shown similar rates of MCPyV-positivity in immunocompetent and suppressed patients, but relied on PCR and IHC for virus detection [18].In the present report, three solid organ transplant recipients, three with chronic autoimmune diseases, and two with hematologic malignancies developed virus-negative MCC. It is well established that the risk for developing MCC is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or medically induced immunosuppression for solid organ transplantation [58,59,60,61]. Within the latter population, skin cancers account for 40‚Äì50% of all posttransplant malignancies with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) comprising 90‚Äì95% of these skin cancers [62]. Importantly, some therapeutics used in organ transplantation are known to further increase risk for developing skin cancers. Azathioprine can sensitize cells to UV-induced damage through the incorporation of a metabolite into DNA that generates reactive oxygen species upon exposure to UV light [63]. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate and anti-TNF drugs were associated with an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer [64]. The increased risk for skin cancers in organ transplant recipients and rheumatoid arthritis is associated with UV-light-induced mutagenesis for SCC and BCC. Therefore, the increased risk for UV-induced skin cancers may also extend to virus-negative MCC. Although this study is one of the largest molecular studies on MCC genetics to date, the small sample size and inherent confounding factors of studying outcome in a cancer that manifests in older populations are important limitations. This also highlights the need for accurate determination of virus status and importance to continue to study this rare cancer to fully address the involvement of immune suppression on the etiology and outcome of this aggressive cancer.Despite the significant differences in the TMB between virus-positive and virus-negative MCC, there were few phenotypic differences in the two types of MCC. Based on histopathological features alone, two subtypes of MCC can be recognized: pure neuroendocrine tumors and combined tumors with neuroendocrine and divergent (mainly squamous) differentiation. Most pure tumors are MCPyV-positive and CK20-positive while combined tumors are uniformly MCPyV-negative and occasionally CK-20 negative [9, 65]. Virus-negative MCC can also present as pure neuroendocrine-type MCC.While genomic sequencing has revealed that virus-negative MCC has evidence for a high degree of UV damage, this does not exclude a role for UV exposure in the development of virus-positive MCC. The relative lack of UV damaged DNA in virus-positive MCC indicates that the etiologies are clearly different, suggesting that the precursor to virus-negative MCC was a recipient of lifelong intense UV exposure while the virus-positive MCC were not exposed to sunlight for the same degree or for as long. It was reported that the early promoter of MCPyV responds to UV exposure and that levels of ST mRNA increased in UV exposed skin from a healthy human volunteer [66]. Transient UV exposure could affect the immune response to virus-negative and virus-positive MCC etiology. The effect of UV radiation in the pathogenesis of MCC has been suggested to be more likely a result of immune modulation rather than direct effects on DNA itself [67].ConclusionsHere we present¬†a comprehensive characterization of the Merkel cell carcinoma genetics using a clinically implemented sequencing platform. This platform was augmented using a hybrid capture baitset against Merkel cell polyomavirus. From our analyses, we identified CNV clusters unique to and common to virus-negative and virus-positive, which reflect the evolutionary mechanisms of the tumors. We also accurately reconstructed the viral integration events providing clear evidence for a circular host-fusion DNA intermediate initiated by recombination at 4+ bp microhomology enriched at low-complexity regions in the human genome. Lastly, we observed a surprising number of virus-negative tumors in immunosuppressed patients in our cohort potentially reflecting a previously misunderstood risk population.

AbstractMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but highly aggressive skin cancer with neuroendocrine features. MCC pathogenesis is associated with either the presence of Merkel cell polyomavirus or chronic exposure to ultraviolet light (UV), which can cause a characteristic pattern of multiple DNA mutations. Notably, in the Northern hemisphere, the majority of MCC cases are of viral aetiology; by contrast, in areas with high UV exposure, UV-mediated carcinogenesis is predominant. The two aetiologies share similar clinical, histopathological and prognostic characteristics. MCC presents with a solitary cutaneous or subcutaneous nodule, most frequently in sun-exposed areas. In fact, UV exposure is probably involved in both viral-mediated and non-viral-mediated carcinogenesis, by contributing to immunosuppression or DNA damage, respectively. Confirmation of diagnosis relies on analyses of histological features and immunological marker expression profiles of the lesion. At primary diagnosis, loco-regional metastases are already present in ‚àº30% of patients. Excision of the tumour is the first-line therapy; if not feasible, radiotherapy can often effectively control the disease. Chemotherapy was the only alternative in advanced-stage or refractory MCC until several clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitors.

Abstract
The current study retrospectively analyzed the results of radiotherapy for clinically localized sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid.We reviewed records of 83 patients with histologically confirmed sebaceous carcinoma who were treated radiotherapeutically between 1983 and 2015. Sixty-five patients (78%) were initially treated with radiotherapy of curative intent, while the remaining 18 patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy due to tumor recurrence or positive surgical margins. Thirty-seven patients belonged to T1‚Äì2, while 46 belonged to T3‚Äì4. All 83 patients were treated with radiotherapy with a median radiation dose of 60 Gy. The median follow-up period was 92.1 months (range, 2.8‚Äì310.3 months).At the time of analysis, 13 patients (15.1%) died, and 36 patients (43.3%) had local recurrence. The 7-year overall survival, freedom from neck lymph node recurrence, and local control (LC) rates for all patients were 83.5%, 75.5%, and 52.3%, respectively. Patients with a tumor size ‚â§10 mm had a higher 7-year LC rate than those with a tumor size >10 mm (58.8% vs 46.6%, P = 0.054). Neck lymph node recurrence was observed in 17 patients (20%) and significantly related to the tumor size. Late toxicity of an eyelid dysfunction of grade 3 was observed in 1 patient with T3 tumor.Radiotherapy for sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid is a reasonable alternative to surgical resection for tumors <10 mm in size with few severe complications, while larger tumors should be treated with surgery if feasible. 
INTRODUCTION
Sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid is an uncommon neoplasm that accounts for <1% of all eyelid tumors and approximately 5% of all eyelid malignancies [1, 2]. This tumor develops most commonly among Asian women of around 70 years of age. Sebaceous carcinoma most commonly arises from the Meibomian glands anterior to the gray line and occasionally from the glands of Zeis or Moll and sebaceous glands in the caruncle [3]. Typical finding of sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid is shown in Figure 1. All too frequently, sebaceous carcinoma is misdiagnosed as chalazion, blepharoconjunctivitis, and basal or squamous cell carcinoma. Through the direct invasion of adjacent organs, such as the eyeball and brain, and distant metastasis in the advanced stages, sebaceous carcinoma results in a disease-related mortality rate of 6‚àí30% [4, 5]. Accordingly, early diagnosis and treatment are imperative. 
Fig. 1.Typical finding of sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid.Open in new tabDownload slideRadical surgical excision with a frozen section control by either a standard method or Mohs micrographic surgery is the most common and effective treatment method of sebaceous carcinoma. However, due to advanced age, presence of coexisting diseases, or refusal of surgery, some patients are unsuitable for surgery. Furthermore, despite a recent progress in reconstructive surgery, eyelid tumors may be difficult to excise completely without functional and cosmetic impairment [6, 7]. Therefore, radiotherapy is a treatment option for patients who refuse or are otherwise unsuitable for surgery. However, limited information is currently available on the role of radiotherapy in treating these tumors.In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy for the treatment of clinically localized sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient characteristics
A retrospective review of medical records in our institution from 1983 to 2015 identified 89 patients with a histologically confirmed sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid. Four patients who had lymph node metastases and/or distant metastases at the time of diagnosis were excluded. Additionally, one patient with a diagnosis of hereditary retinoblastoma was excluded because of prior ocular irradiation with a total dose of 40 Gy, and another patient who was irradiated palliatively with only 30 Gy in 15 fractions was also excluded. The remaining 83 patients with clinically localized tumors were included in this analysis. All patients were treated with radiotherapy with curative intent. Patient and treatment characteristics are shown in Table 1. There were 37 men and 46 women. The patients‚Äô age ranged from 28 to 94 years with a median of 67 years, and their Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ranged from 0 to 3 (median, 1). The maximum tumor size ranged from 4 to 35 mm (median, 12 mm), while a tumor size <10 mm was noted in 25 patients. Epithelial invasion was identified in 34 patients (41%).

The principle of treatment of the eyelid sebaceous carcinoma was considered to be surgery for any T stage, however, if there was a serious systemic disease, large plastic surgery was required, or for refusal of surgery, radiotherapy was used as an initial treatment. Of the 18 patients who underwent surgical resection, 11 patients underwent salvage radiotherapy for postoperative recurrent tumors, while 7 patients were treated with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy for positive surgical margins. In the current study, we used the TNM staging system of the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC) 6th edition [8]. In patients undergoing postoperative salvage radiotherapy, T stage was allocated to the recurrent tumor size, while patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy were classified by the preoperative tumor status. Seven patients had a T1 tumor, 30 patients had a T2 tumor, 38 patients had a T3 tumor, and 8 patients had a T4 tumor. Treatments
All 83 patients were treated with radiotherapy with curative intent. The treatment volume was determined based on physical examinations, pretreatment computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and the planning target volume (PTV) included at least 5-mm margins from the primary tumor. Radiotherapy was administered with 3‚Äì12 MeV electron appositional field in 77 patients (93%), and 4 MV X-rays were used in 6 patients (7%). X-ray irradiation was delivered with a single anterior portal in 3 patients and two anterior angled portals in the remaining 3 patients. Two patients undergoing X-ray irradiation had T4 tumor, one had invasion of striated muscles of the orbit, and another had invasion of the nasal bone and bulbar conjunctiva. During radiotherapy, a bolus was used in 35 patients (42.2%). Thickness of the bolus was 5 mm in 15 patients, 10 mm in 1 patient, and records of the bolus thickness were lacking in the remaining 19 patients. A lead-based lens block was inserted between the eyelid and eyeball with local anesthetics and lubricant in 68 patients (81.9%). In the remaining patients, the eye was fixed by gazing at an object in the contralateral side to exclude the lens from the direct radiation beam. The dose of electron beam irradiation was prescribed to the peak dose point of the beam central axis, and the electron energy was selected to enclose the PTV with at least 80% of the peak dose. In X-ray irradiation, the dose was prescribed to the isocenter. Daily fractional dose of 1.8‚Äì2.0 Gy, administered 5 days per week, was used in 77 of 83 patients (92.8%), while daily fractional dose of 2.2‚Äì2.5 Gy was used in the remaining 6 patients. The total dose for the primary tumor in all patients ranged from 48.0 to 70.4 Gy (median, 60.0 Gy). To compare various radiotherapies with different fractional doses, the equivalent dose in a fractional dose of 2 Gy (EQD2 Gy) was calculated according to the Linear-Quadratic (LQ) model assuming a/b = 10 Gy. Statistical analysis
The median follow-up period for all 83 patients was 92.1 months (range, 2.8‚Äì310.3 months). Overall survival (OS), freedom from neck lymph node recurrence (FFNR), and local control (LC) rates were calculated according to the Kaplan‚àíMeier method [9], starting from the initiation of radiotherapy. In the univariate analysis, statistical differences were estimated using the log-rank test [10]. Multivariate analyses for LC, FFNR, and OS were performed by Cox proportional hazards model using potential prognostic factors employed in the univariate analysis. A probability level <0.05 indicated statistical significance. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software (version 23.0; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Late toxicities were graded according to the CTCAE version 4.0 [11]. This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. RESULTS
At the time of this analysis, 36 patients (43.3%) had disease recurrences. Twenty-three patients had only local recurrence, 3 had only neck lymph node recurrence, 13 had both local and neck lymph node recurrences, 1 had neck lymph node recurrence and distant metastases, and 4 had local and neck lymph node recurrences and distant metastases (Figure 2). Therefore, local recurrence was noted in 36 patients (43.3%), and neck lymph node recurrence in 17 patients (20%). 
Fig. 2.Recurrence pattern of 83 patients with sebaceous carcinoma after radiotherapy.Open in new tabDownload slideThe 7-year LC rate of all 83 patients was 52.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) :0.40‚Äì0.64]. Patients with a tumor size ‚â§10 mm had a higher 7-year LC rate than those with a tumor size >10 mm (58.8% vs 46.6%, P = 0.054) (Table 2, Fig. 3). If the analysis was confined to patients undergoing radiotherapy of ‚â•60 Gy in EQD2 Gy, 7-year LC rates of T1‚Äì2 (33 patients) and T3‚Äì4 (41 patients) were 60.0% and 44.2%, respectively, with an almost statistically significant difference (P = 0.053). Six patients had a late local recurrence more than 5 years after radiation therapy and only local recurrence without lymph node and distant metastases. Three of them were treated with local resection, and the other 3 patients were treated with exenteration of the eyelid and orbital contents, with all 6 patients successfully salvaged without further recurrence. We also analyzed the LC rate of patients undergoing postoperative salvage radiotherapy for recurrent tumor and those undergoing postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy for positive surgical margins. Although the 7-year LC rate in postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy group was favorable compared with those of postoperative salvage radiotherapy group (71.4% vs 51.9%, respectively; P = 0.736), a statistically significant difference in LC was not shown because 1 patient in the postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy group had local recurrence 9 years after radiotherapy. In the multivariate analysis, tumor size and radiation dose did not have a statistically significant impact on LC (Table 2).

(C) Overall survival.Open in new tabDownload slideThe 7-year FFNR rate of all 83 patients was 75.5% (95%CI: 0.65‚Äì0.86). The relatively high rate of neck lymph node recurrence (17 of 83 patients, 20%) prompted us to investigate the risk factors for its recurrence. Table 2 shows the FFNR rates according to various potential risk factors. In the univariate analysis, patients with a tumor size ‚â§10 mm had a significantly higher 7-year FFNR rate than those with a larger tumor size (88.4% and 63.3%, respectively; P = 0.037; Table 2, Fig. 3). However, in the multivariate analysis, tumor size did not have a statistically significance effect on FFNR (Table 2).Of 83 patients, 13 (15.1%) died during the follow-up period. Of these 13 patients, 4 died of sebaceous carcinoma, and the remaining 9 died without clinical recurrence: lung cancer (n = 3) and pancreatic cancer (n = 1) were the causes of death, and five patients died of unknown cause (n = 5). The 7-year OS rate for all patients was 83.5% (95%CI: 0.74‚Äì0.93), and age had a significant impact on OS in the univariate and multivariate analyses (Table 2).Table 3 outlines the late toxicities in all patients. Grade 3 or more late toxicities were observed in only 1 patient (grade 3 eyelid dysfunction). This patient had T3 tumor that was treated with radiotherapy with a total dose of 60 Gy. Grade 2 cataract developed in 1 patient. Twenty-five patients had cataract already before radiation therapy due to old age. We could not find any relationship between lead-based lens block and late toxicities. Moreover, approximately 10‚Äì30% of patients had grade 1‚Äì2 late toxicities including watery eye, dry eye, eyelid dysfunction, and keratitis.

This is the largest study on radiotherapy of sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid, which includes 83 patients. Surgical resection has been considered as the standard treatment of sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid. However, the current study revealed that radiotherapy yields comparable LC in sebaceous carcinoma with a tumor size ‚â§10 mm (58.8% at 7 years). Although the proportions of patients with early-stage tumors were not documented, several studies have reported the efficacy of radiotherapy in LC of sebaceous carcinoma [12, 13]. Hata et al. treated 5 patients with radical radiotherapy for gross tumors with a median maximum diameter of 12 mm and found that all 5 patients achieved LC [13]. Pardo et al. analyzed 4 patients treated with radical radiotherapy (total doses of 45‚Äì63 Gy) and found that no patients had recurrences at the primary tumor sites during the follow-up period of 60‚Äì17 months [12]. After wide local excision or Mohs micrographic surgery, sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid can be controlled locally in 60‚Äì90% [14‚Äì17]. Erovic et al. analyzed 33 patients with periorbital sebaceous carcinomas (76% were classified as T1 or T2) treated with primary surgery. The 5-year LC rate was 63%, and the 5-year regional control rate was 58% [17]. The radiotherapeutic results of sebaceous carcinoma with a tumor size ‚â§10 mm in the current study seemed to be comparable to the surgical series. However, LC rate in the current study was lower than that in the recent series on Mohs micrographic surgery. Previous reports on Mohs micrographic surgery had a small sample size and shorter follow-up period than the current study [15]. Sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid can recur locally very late even after 5 years as stated. Therefore, long-term follow-up is also needed in the surgery reports.Moreover, the current study indicated that radiotherapy achieved a 7-year LC rate of 46.6% even for sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid with a larger tumor size (>10 mm, including T4). Several authors emphasized that a tumor size >10 mm and extensive invasion (represented as T3-4 tumors) are closely related to the risk of recurrence and metastases [18]. This study revealed that radiotherapy can be a viable alternative to surgery even in the patients with T3-4 tumors. In our study, patients with T4 tumor had a higher 7-year LC rate than those with T2 and T3 tumors (56.3%, 56.0%, and 44.1%, respectively; Table 2), for which we could not determine the reason. However, a favorable LC rate of T4 tumors might be related to the small tumor size <20 mm in 5 of 7 patients with T4 tumors.The optimal dose for radiotherapy with curative intent for sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid remains unknown. Nunery et al. found that all 6 patients with sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid experienced local recurrence with radical radiotherapy at total doses of 33‚Äì54 Gy (median, 50 Gy) in 1.8‚Äì3.1 Gy fraction size [19]. Hendley et al. treated 3 patients with sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid with radiotherapy at 48 Gy and observed local recurrence in a single patient [20]. In contrast, Hata et al. conducted definitive radiotherapy with total doses of 60‚Äì66 Gy in 5 patients with sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid with fraction sizes of 1.8‚Äì2 Gy in 4 patients and 3 Gy in 1 patient. The authors found no recurrences within the radiation field in any of the treated patients [13]. In the current study, a 7-year LC rate of 60.0% was obtained in patients with T1-2 tumors treated with ‚â•60 Gy. The results suggest that a dose of ‚â•60 Gy in conventional fractionation may be insufficient to eradicate even T1-2 tumors. The 7-year LC rate in a postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy group was favorable compared with those of a postoperative salvage radiotherapy group and initial definitive radiotherapy group (71.4% vs 51.9%, 51.1%). In the postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy group, 3 of 7 patients had local recurrence. One patient treated with 50 Gy recurred in 108.9 months after radiotherapy. The other 2 patients treated with 60 Gy recurred in 6.3 months and 14.3 months after radiotherapy, respectively. While the remaining 4 patients treated with >60 Gy in EQD2Gy (1 patient was 59.4 Gy in 27 fractions, 2 patients were 60 Gy in 30 fractions and 1 patient was 66 Gy in 33 fractions) achieved LC. Therefore, we consider that a dose of ‚â§60 Gy was insufficient to eradicate even in a postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy setting. The bolus was used only in 35 of 77 patients who underwent electron beam therapy. Without bolus, the surface dose is lower, especially in 3-MeV electron irradiation. Additionally, PTV was enclosed by at least 80% of the prescription dose in electron irradiation. Therefore, the dose to PTV appear be lower than the prescribed dose in some patients. Further optimization of electron beam irradiation might improve the LC rate of sebaceous carcinoma.The optimal radiation field for sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid is also unknown. When performing surgery, several authors recommended that surgical margins of 5‚Äì6 mm are required to completely excise tumors at a microscopic level [6, 21]. For example, Dogru et al. reported that recurrence occurred in the primary lesion in 36% of patients who underwent surgical resection with 1‚Äì3-mm margins from the edge of gross tumors but that no local recurrence was observed in patients with at least 5-mm margins [21]. Hata et al. treated 5 patients with gross tumors by radiotherapy with 10-mm margins and found that no patients had local recurrences [13]. In the current study, we could not obtain adequate information regarding the patterns of local failure, such as in-field, marginal, or out-field recurrence. However, considering the previous reports, the gross tumor with at least 5-mm margins appears to be preferable for clinical target volume when conducting radiotherapy.Sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid has often been reported to lead to neck lymph node recurrence, particularly in the preauricular, parotid, or submandibular lymph nodes in 8‚àí32% of patients [4, 5]. In agreement with the previous series, 20% of patients treated with radical radiotherapy in the current study developed neck lymph node recurrence. It remains unknown whether prophylactic irradiation to the neck lymph nodes is necessary for patients with clinically N0 tumors. Our results indicated that tumor size was a significant risk factor for FFNR in the univariate analysis. Esmaeli et al. reported that T stage was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis in surgery cases [22]. To our knowledge, the current study is the first report to indicate the risk factors for neck lymph node recurrence in patients treated with radiotherapy. The 7-year FFNR rate was 88.4% in patients with a tumor size ‚â§10 mm but only 63.3% in patients with a larger tumor size. Additionally, of 17 patients with neck lymph node recurrences, 13 patients had both local and neck lymph node recurrences. Ten of 13 patients had local recurrence before or concurrent with neck lymph node recurrence (Figure 2). This suggests that improvement in LC could favorably affect FFNR. However, prophylactic neck irradiation appears to be warranted in patients with a tumor size >10 mm, including T4 tumors. A total dose of 45‚Äì50 Gy appears to be appropriate for prophylactic neck irradiation in patients with N0 diseases. Indeed, Hata et al. performed prophylactic neck irradiation with doses of 44‚Äì50.5 Gy and reported no neck lymph node recurrences within the radiation field [13].Recently, systemic chemotherapy with various agents, such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil, is reported to have achieved a significant reduction in the volume of bulky eyelid tumors and contributed to prolonged survival [23]. Therefore, multimodal treatment, including surgery and radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, may be appropriate for T3-4 tumors.In the current study, late morbidity of grade 3 or more was observed in only 1 patient, suggesting that radiotherapy in the treatment of these tumors is quite safe. Only 1 patient developed radiation-induced cataract. Several authors have also indicated that radical radiotherapy is associated with few severe late toxicities [1]. In the current study, approximately 10‚Äì30% of patients experienced grade 1‚Äì2 late toxicities, including watery eye, dry eye, eyelid dysfunction, and keratitis with a median total dose of 60 Gy. These results indicate that radiotherapy is associated with few grade 3 or higher late toxicities, while some patients may have grade 1‚Äì2 late toxicities. However, the true incidence of radiation-induced cataract might be underestimated because cataract had already been present before radiation therapy in 25 patients due to old age. Lead shields may be effective in reducing late toxicities, but we could not find the correlation between lead shields and late toxicities. Because of the retrospective nature of this study and the study period extending to more than 30 years, some patients were lost to follow-up, and the incidence of late toxicities may be underestimated. CONCLUSION
Radiotherapy for sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid is a reasonable alternative to surgical resection for tumors <10 mm in size with few severe complications, while larger tumors should be treated with surgery with or without radiotherapy, if feasible. Radiotherapy alone can be a reasonable alternative even for patients with T3‚Äì4 tumors (>10 mm) if surgical removal is not possible. Prophylactic neck irradiation appears to be required for patients with T3-4 tumors. Further investigations are required to determine the optimal radiation dose and field for radiotherapy of sebaceous carcinoma. CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Abstract

 


BACKGROUND:  Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare malignant tumor of the skin adnexa. While surgical resection is a treatment of choice in localized disease, frequent recurrence and distant metastasis make treatment difficult. Moreover, due to its rarity, optimal systemic treatment has not been determined. 

CASE REPORT:  A 59-year-old female presented with disseminated subcutaneous nodules. Past history indicated she received repeated surgery, radiation therapy, and fluorouracil-based systemic chemotherapy for recurrent sebaceous carcinoma. Following a subcutaneous nodule biopsy, histopathologic examination confirmed recurrent metastasis of sebaceous carcinoma. Because there was no established regimen as salvage chemotherapy, we decided to administer paclitaxel plus Adriamycin as a combination regimen after a thorough search of previous reports on PubMed. After the patient received 6 cycles of chemotherapy, all masses dramatically regressed. Unfortunately, several new lesions appeared 3 months after cessation of chemotherapy. Therefore, she was treated with anti-HGF antibody through a clinical trial. After that, she received nivolumab. But treatment with all the new agents did not show any response. Furthermore, her disease progressed rapidly. We re-challenged with the paclitaxel and Adriamycin regimen, 2 cycles of chemotherapy, and the follow-up positron emission tomography - computed tomography revealed marked decrement of multiple metastatic nodules. 

CONCLUSIONS:  Although several clinical reports have shown the effectiveness of fluorouracil, especially 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, there has been a paucity of reports on other chemotherapeutic agents. We report a case of metastatic sebaceous carcinoma which showed favorable response to non-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy.

AbstractBackgroundThere have hardly been any reported cases of children presenting with Kaposi sarcoma as a second malignancy following treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia outside a transplant setting.Case presentationWe report a case of a 5-year-old boy of Bantu origin, which, to our knowledge, could be only the second reported case of  oral‚Äìvisceral Kaposi sarcoma after acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment. The patient presented with a 1-month history of progressive, non-painful, soft tissue oral mass, 1¬†month after completing treatment for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He was successfully treated for Kaposi sarcoma on a two-drug regimen (bleomycin and vincristine) with good clinical response.ConclusionVisceral Kaposi sarcoma as a second malignancy may occur after pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment, but its rarity makes it unlikely to raise suspicion among clinicians, thus precluding early diagnosis and treatment. We recommend routine evaluation for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in children undergoing long-term surveillance following treatment for childhood acute leukemia.


Peer Review reports

IntroductionKaposi sarcoma (KS), as a second malignancy following treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), particularly in the absence of transplant, has rarely been reported in children [1], and depreciates ALL treatment outcomes, especially in low-resource settings where survival generally remains low. First described by Moritz Kaposi in 1972 [2, 3], KS is an angioproliferative multicentric disease of lymphatic endothelium-derived cells. It is classified into four distinct clinicopathological subtypes based on the clinical condition in which it develops: (1) the classic or sporadic form mostly occurs in lower extremities in elderly patients of Mediterranean or Jewish origin, (2) the endemic form which is prevalent in middle-aged adults and children from sub-Saharan Africa, (3) the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)-associated or epidemic KS, and (4) the iatrogenic form of KS, which is associated with immunosuppressive therapies for transplants or malignancies and other chronic inflammatory diseases [4, 5]. These variants portray different courses and epidemiology, but with similar histological features, and human herpes virus-8 (HHV8) is considered the causative agent for all forms of KS [4, 5].The iatrogenic variant of KS occurs in patients who are immune-suppressed following organ transplant (particularly kidney transplants), chemotherapy, or rheumatologic disease [6], usually appearing a year after the first administration of the drugs. However, the occurrence of KS in children as a second primary malignancy following acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy in general, and outside transplant settings in particular, are scarce. Herein we report a case of iatrogenic KS in a 5-year-old boy, who presented with oral KS lesions (with visceral involvement) following ALL treatment (2¬†years and 8¬†months from the time he was first diagnosed with and initiated treatment for ALL).Case reportA 5-year-old boy, of Bantu ethnicity, presented with a 1-month history of progressive, non-painful, soft tissue mass in the left palatal ridge, first noted in July 2021. He was otherwise well and had no reported constitutional symptoms, no jaw swelling and no abdominal or central nervous system symptoms. He had been earlier diagnosed with pre-B ALL [high risk owing to a high white blood cell count, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria] at 3¬†years of age, for which he was treated at our center according to local protocol (Additional file 1) between November 2018 and June 2021, with well-achieved remission [minimal residual disease (MRD) negative], and had started long term surveillance. He did not receive irradiation or hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation during the first-line ALL treatment. His family and psychosocial history were unremarkable, and he had largely enjoyed normal growth, development, and health. A physical examination revealed a bluish‚Äìpurplish mass in the left palatal ridge (Fig.¬†1) and no other significant findings (general or systemic).Fig. 1Iatrogenic oral KS lesions in a 5-year-old patientFull size imageA biopsy of the suspicious lesion was taken, and the histology was compatible with KS nodular stage. The hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stained sections, illustrated in Fig.¬†2, showed a tumor composed of nodules of spindle-shaped cells with mild atypia (Fig.¬†2A) and extravasated blood cells and proliferating vascular slits (Fig.¬†2B).Fig. 2Histopathology (H & E staining) [40¬†√ó]. A A tumor composed of nodules and spindle-shaped cells with mild atypia, B extravasated blood cells and proliferating vascular slitsFull size imageAn abdominal ultrasound scan revealed multiple enlarged intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies (para-aortic and mesenteric), the largest approximately 2.5¬†cm in longest diameter. Occult fecal blood was positive. The plain chest radiograph was largely normal (Fig.¬†3).Fig. 3Chest radiograph. A Antero-posterior view, B lateral view, showing normal mediastinal and hilar regions.Full size imageThe complete blood count, coagulation profile, and general chemistry were normal. The serological test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody was negative. HHV8 assay and other immunological tests could not be performed at our center because of the lack of a testing facility. The final pathology diagnosis was iatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma. The patient was started on bleomycin (B) 10¬†IU/m2 3¬†weekly and vincristine (V) 1.5¬†mg/m2 weekly (BV) according to local protocol, with complete clinical remission after four cycles of chemotherapy (Fig.¬†4)‚Äîdefined as the disappearance of all clinical manifestations, including tumor-associated edema. The child‚Äôs clinical course was monitored by routine physical assessment and basic imaging studies.Fig. 4Complete resolution of oral KS after chemotherapyFull size imageThe repeat abdominal ultrasonography and chest radiograph were normal, and the fecal occult blood test was negative by the fourth cycle of chemotherapy. He went on to receive a total of six cycles of the BV treatment regimen and continues to be monitored with regular evaluation.DiscussionThis case is unique in the following aspects: While several cases of transplant-related iatrogenic KS have been described [7,8,9], reports on the occurrence of KS in children as a second primary malignancy following acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy outside transplant settings are scarce. This is possibly only the second reported case of oral/visceral KS as a second malignancy in a child following ALL treatment, occurring outside the transplant setting. Further, KS has been infrequently reported as a complication following therapy of ALL in children.Kaposi sarcoma (KS), first described by Moritz Kaposi in 1872 [2, 3], is a spindle-cell, slowly progressive multifocal lymphoangioproliferative neoplasm induced by a gamma herpes virus, the human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8), in predisposed individuals [4, 10]. There are four known clinical variants of KS, with different courses and epidemiology, but similar etiology: (a) epidemic or AIDS-associated KS, (b) classic KS (in elderly Mediterranean men), (c) endemic or African KS, and (d) iatrogenic KS, affecting immunosuppressed patients and organ transplant recipients [4, 10].Infection with HHV-8 underlies a common etiology of all the subtypes of KS. However, though considered necessary, HHV-8 is not sufficient for the development of sarcoma, implying other factors (genetic, immunological, and environmental) are also necessary for the pathogenesis, together with immunosuppression [4, 10,11,12,13]. The iatrogenic form of KS, due to immunosuppression, is typically associated with the use of immunosuppressive therapy in organ transplant recipients (particularly kidney transplants). It can also occur in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments for proliferative disorders/malignant processes or immune-mediated diseases [4, 6, 14, 15] as well as the use of oral corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents [6, 16, 17], with KS appearing usually about a year after the first administration of the drugs in these cases.Here we report a case, which according to our knowledge from the review of literature, could be only the second reported case of Kaposi sarcoma following treatment for ALL, occurring outside the setting of a transplant, and the first with iatrogenic KS developing just over 2¬†years of ALL diagnosis in a child. One earlier documented case in the literature was of a 5-year-old girl who developed visceral KS 7¬†years after ALL treatment and clinical remission, and was only identified in autopsy findings [1]. A latter report by Sala et¬†al. [18] was of a 10-year-old who developed KS just over a year following partially matched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.In a subsequent review of 61 reported cases of second neoplasms in children and adults with ALL, the most frequent second tumors were other acute leukemias [mainly acute myeloid leukemia (AML)], lymphomas [mainly Hodgkin disease (HD)], and other solid tumors [19] other than KS. The majority of the secondary KS reported to date were in adults, mostly following solid organ transplants and immunosuppressive therapy for chronic inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus [5], Crohn‚Äôs disease [20], asthma [21], Wegener‚Äôs granulomatosis [22], or following transplant [23]. For instance, in Iran, Ramzi and colleagues reported a case of iatrogenic KS in a 44-year-old female after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) relapse [24].The pathogenic mechanism underlying KS in patients treated for ALL is still not well known, though decreased immunity seems to be the overarching factor. By and large, the current most accepted hypothesis for the development of iatrogenic KS, in general, is supposed to stem from a weakening of the immunological surveillance system by immunosuppressive agents, resulting in the reactivation of a pre-existent HHV-8 infection and giving rise to the proliferative transformation of the infected endothelial cells [14]. In this respect, the pathogenesis is believed to relate to inhibition of transforming growth factor (TGF)-Œ≤ and reactivation of latent HHV-8 infection, which leads to the induction of angiogenesis [4]. As postulated for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the role of an ineffective T-cell response to HHV-8 latent infection, consequent to the generally decreased immunity, cannot be ignored [10], but other risk factors probably exist. Additionally, carcinogenesis may be a feature of chemotherapy in cancer¬†treatment [25] and, only in the case of some organ transplant recipients, HHV-8 seroconversion may follow the immunosuppression, suggesting infection from the donated organ [26].In general, the clinical manifestation of iatrogenic KS tends to be exclusive to cutaneous and/or mucosal involvement, though widespread disseminated forms with visceral involvement, as was the case in our patient, may also occur [14]. The objective for the management of KS is to manage the symptoms as treatment is often not curative, and prognosis depends on the disease severity at presentation [27]. Patients with systemic disseminated KS, as in our case, require systemic chemotherapy [28]. The clinical manifestations of KS following significant immunosuppression generally resolve, in most cases, when the immunosuppressive therapy is changed, reduced, or discontinued [5]. However, the reduction or elimination of immunosuppression does not always lead to the resolution of KS [4], and maintaining immunosuppression frequently leads to further disease progression [14]. Literature and current data regarding the treatment of KS following ALL treatment in children are lacking. Sala et¬†al. reported achievement of complete remission with pegylated lysosomal doxorubicin used to treat visceral KS in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, with a disease-free state after 33¬†months of ongoing follow-up [18]. Pegylated lysosomal doxorubicin was similarly effective in the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi patients in a report by Di Lorenzo et¬†al. [29]. However, as noted by Sala et¬†al. in their report, the use of anthracylines in the treatment of KS following ALL treatment may be limited by the increased risk of cardiotoxicity from anthracyclines administered during the first-line treatment of acute leukemia [18].Another agent, sirolimus, has shown mixed results when used in the treatment of dermal KS in post-renal transplant recipients. For instance, Stallone et¬†al. [30], just like other authors [31, 32], demonstrated a potential role of sirolimus in inhibiting the progression of KS in kidney transplant recipients, postulated to occur through the down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis [30, 33]. On the contrary, Tanja Graf et¬†al. reported no response to sirolimus when used in the treatment of cutaneous KS in a 36-year-old renal transplant recipient [34]. Here we report a case of successful use of a combination of bleomycin and vincristine in the treatment of oral‚Äìvisceral KS in a child following ALL treatment, with remarkable improvement noted by the fourth of the 3-weekly cycles of this regimen, with disease-free status after about 1¬†year of ongoing follow-up. We believe this presents a significant result, especially for the treatment of KS in a resource-limited setting, because of the main advantages of this regimen, which are low¬†cost, ease of administration, and minimal adverse effects.This case report derives its strength from its uniqueness‚Äîbeing one of very few reported cases of oral/visceral KS as a second malignancy in a child following ALL treatment that occurs outside the transplant setting. The main limitations of this case report include the lack of an immunological study for HHV-8 and the short duration of patient follow-up, which limits the conclusion on long-term prognosis.ConclusionVisceral KS as a second malignancy may occur after pediatric ALL treatment, but its rarity makes it unlikely to raise suspicion among clinicians, thus precluding early diagnosis and treatment. We recommend routine evaluation for KS lesions in children undergoing long-term surveillance following treatment for childhood malignancies, including acute leukemia. The administration of a combination of bleomycin and vincristine in the setting of discontinued immunosuppressive therapy may represent a relatively safe, effective therapeutic approach for these children, especially in low-resource contexts.

Abstract:
Kaposi sarcoma is relatively common after solid organ transplantation, but very rare after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Here we are reporting a rare case of Kaposi sarcoma in a child after HSCT. An 11-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia was treated by haploidentical HSCT from his father. Three weeks after transplantation, the patient developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) which was treated by immunosuppressive therapy and extracorporeal photopheresis. Approximately 6.5 months after HSCT, the patient had asymptomatic nodular skin lesions over the scalp, chest, and face. Histopathological examination showed typical findings of Kaposi sarcoma. Later, additional lesions in the liver and oral cavity were confirmed. Liver biopsy was positive for HHV-8 antibodies. The patient was continued on Sirolimus which was already being used for the treatment of GVHD. Cutaneous lesions were also treated with topical timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution. Within six months, cutaneous and mucous membrane lesions were completely resolved. Follow-up abdominal ultrasound and MRI showed the disappearance of the hepatic lesion.

  1. IntroductionKaposi sarcoma (KS) is an angio-proliferative tumor characterized by spindle-shaped vascular cells, typically initiated by an infection with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV8), immunosuppression, or immunodeficiency [1]. However, HHV-8 infection alone does not necessarily cause KS [1]. Other factors including genetic, immunological, and environmental factors contribute to the development of KS [2,3]. It is a multifocal disease affecting mainly the skin and to a lesser extent the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, and lungs [1]. Epidemiologically, Kaposi sarcoma has four different types: sporadic (classic), endemic (African), epidemic (AIDS-related), and iatrogenic (transplant-related) [4]. The latter is relatively common after solid organ transplantation, especially the kidney, liver, and heart [5,6]. It affects up to 1.5% of solid organ recipients [5,6]. However, Kaposi sarcoma is very rare after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) [7]. The risk of post-transplantation Kaposi sarcoma is probably caused by prolonged use of immunosuppressive therapy after transplantation, which may ultimately reactivate HHV8 infection [1,8]. Additionally, the majority of frequently used immunosuppressive therapies are pro-carcinogenic [9]. Here, we report a rare case of Kaposi sarcoma in a child after HSCT.  2. Case ReportAn 11-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia (FANCA gene mutation) was treated by haploidentical HSCT from his father. The patient had no HLA match with any of his tested family members. The patient was seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HHV8 tests. The father was not tested for HHV-8. The conditioning regimen was the following:Fludarabine 50 mg injection, vial (26 mg IV Piggyback over 1 h for 1 day) injected every 24 h on day (-7), (-6), (-5), (-4) and (-3)ATG (Genzyme) anti-human T-lymphocyte immune globulin ATG rabbit, 25mg inj (10 mg IV Syringe infused as protocol) with concentration of 0.33 mg/mL, injected on day (-5) and day (-4)For graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, the patient received cyclophosphamide, two doses of 500 mg intravenously, with 80 mL of dextrose 5% in water over one hour, on day + 3 and day + 4, while Cyclosporine was started on day + 5, then mycophenolate mofetil was also added but Cyclosporine was changed to Tacrolimus on day + 12 due to severe headache. Three weeks after transplantation, the patient developed a biopsy-proven GVHD that involved the skin (acute GVHD stage 1) and later the gut (acute GVHD stage 1). The overall clinical acute GVHD grade was grade two [10]. The patient was started on corticosteroids (Prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day and Budesonide) and was also started on antitumor kinase inhibitors (Sirolimus and Ruxolitinib) since studies showed the efficacy of lower doses of prednisone of 1 mg/kg/day or even 0.5 mg/kg/day [11]. As the GVHD did not improve with the above medications, the patient was admitted and additionally started on extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP). Post-transplant chimerism results are mentioned in Table 1.During hospitalization and after two months from the HSCT, abdominal ultrasound showed small nodular lesions in the liver, which were not accessible for liver biopsy. The lesions were thought to be fungal and treated with multiple courses of antifungal medications (voriconazole) but without improvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed signal characteristics favoring hepatic regenerative/dysplastic nodules rather than a fungal infection. Additionally, the patient received multiple systemic medications to treat various conditions during hospitalization. These included phosphonomethanoic acid (foscarnet) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulins for PCR-confirmed CMV infection, metronidazole, and then vancomycin for PCR-confirmed clostridium difficile infection, cidofovir for hematuria with positive human polyomavirus 1 (BK virus), cefepime and amikacin for fever of unknown origin, insulin for steroid-induced hyperglycemia, and amlodipine for high blood pressure.Approximately 7.5 months after HSCT, the patient was referred to dermatology during his admission. At that time, the patient had a one-month history of asymptomatic nodular lesions over the scalp, chest, and face (Figure 1). The lesions started first on the scalp, which was followed a few weeks later by similar lesions in the chest and face. On examination, the patient was conscious, well, and vitally stable. There were multiple violaceous firm purpuric nodules over the face, scalp, and chest. There were no lesions in mucous membranes nor genital areas. The differential diagnosis included leukemia cutis, pseudolymphoma, cutaneous fungal or bacterial infection, nodular vasculitis, and Kaposi sarcoma. Two skin biopsies were taken from the lesions; the first was taken from the chest nodule and the second was taken from the scalp nodule. For the first biopsy, histopathological examination showed typical findings of Kaposi sarcoma while the direct immunofluorescence (DIF) examination was negative for deposits of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, IgM, and C3. For the second biopsy, bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures were performed with negative results.Further investigations were then started to clarify the non-improved liver lesions. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed multiple hypermetabolic small hepatic foci in a background of heterogeneous liver uptake, which raised the suspicion of liver involvement with Kaposi sarcoma. A liver biopsy was then performed, and the liver tissue showed focal intersecting fascicles of uniform spindle cells and intervening blood-filled spaces between spindle cells. Additionally, the tissue was positive for HHV-8 antibodies (13B10 clone), which is consistent with Kaposi sarcoma. Furthermore, it was positive for CD31 antibodies (JC70A clone), CD34 antibodies (Qbend/10 clone), and smooth muscle actin (SMA, 1A4 clone) but negative for Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus (RNA in situ hybridization). Two months later, the patient developed erythematous flat patches to the right of the base of the frenulum, the mid-soft palate, and behind the upper left third molar, suggestive of mucous membrane involvement with Kaposi sarcoma.For the cutaneous lesions of Kaposi sarcoma, the patient was started on topical timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution (with two drops applied three times daily over the skin nodules, not exceeding 10 drops total per application). The patient was continued on Sirolimus which was already being used for the treatment of GVHD. The patient was also on oral propranolol for treating high blood pressure which could helped in treating both cutaneous and hepatic Kaposi sarcoma. With topical treatments (as adjunctive treatments), the skin nodules started to flatten, and the mucous membrane lesions started to disappear. Within six months, the topical medications were discontinued with complete resolution of skin and mucous membrane lesions. Follow-up abdominal ultrasound and MRI showed the disappearance of the hepatic lesion. The patient had a good response to ECP and Sirolimus with the disappearance of gut GVHD and significant improvement of the skin GVHD. After that, ECP was discontinued and Sirolimus has been tapered off.  3. DiscussionWe are reporting the case of a child with Kaposi sarcoma after haploidentical HSCT. Kaposi sarcoma is a rare complication of HSCT, and a recent report estimated its occurrence at a rate of 0.11% (one in 10,000 HSCT recipients) [7]. The total number of similar cases reported over the last three decades is approximately 32 cases [7]. Additionally, the current case report is considered an infrequent presentation of this rare complication. For example, this is probably the first case in a child with Fanconi anemia treated by HSCT. Children represent less than 30% of previously reported post-HSCT Kaposi sarcoma cases [7]. In contrast with the current case, previously reported post-HSCT Kaposi sarcoma in children had frequent lymph node involvement but no liver involvement [7]. Lastly, haploidentical HSCT from the father was previously reported in only two children [12,13]. Nevertheless, the current case report shared several characteristics that have been associated with post-HSCT Kaposi sarcoma: non-autologous HSCT, chronic GVHD, multifocal presentation, skin and oral cavity involvement, and short duration between HSCT and diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma [7]. Skin lesions appeared in the current patient 6.5 months from HSCT compared to a median of 7 to 8 months in the Cesaro series and literature review [7].The use of immunosuppressant drugs for the prevention of GVHD is known to be a predisposing factor for KS. A study reported that 91% of patients with Kaposi sarcoma in organ transplant recipients were seropositive for HHV-8 before transplantation [14]. Likewise, seronegative recipients can be infected with seropositive allograph; however, caution should be taken to detect seropositive by using different assays to reduce false negativity. Studies have also shown that KS didn‚Äôt develop in posttransplant seropositive patients until the immunosuppression was started, suggesting the reactivation of the virus [14,15]. Although testing is helpful for the prediction of KS in the recipient, it is also challenging as there is no validated serology kit that is commercially available [16]. Recent technologies, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) have been utilized for the early detection of HHV-8 and other infectious disease loads [17].HHV-8 infection post-HSCT is common; however, Kaposi sarcoma with visceral involvement in the pediatric population is rare. In our case, the liver lesion of Kaposi sarcoma was initially misdiagnosed and treated as a fungal infection. The accurate diagnosis was confirmed only after the appearance of skin lesions suggestive of Kaposi sarcoma. Although this may reflect the unexpected clinical presentation, the findings underscore the importance of keeping Kaposi sarcoma in the differential diagnosis of post-HSCT complications. Further, KS was also reported to involve the lungs [12], tonsils, hard palate, paranasal sinuses [13], oral cavity, lymph node, and gut [3]. Another paper by Avivi et al., 2011, reported a case of KS in a young patient (46-years-old) post T-cell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplant for chronic myeloid leukemia [18]. The author reported that the patient did not receive any prophylaxis for GVHD, however, the patient developed grade II GVHD after four months, and therefore low dose prednisolone therapy was started. In our case, the patient developed GVHD after three weeks. The first sign of KS in the case report of Avivi et al. appeared after six months as nodular lesions on the patient‚Äôs trunk, legs, and oral cavity followed by respiratory nodules and liver failure with multiple hepatic nodules. Biopsies of lesions showed disseminated visceral KS. Interferon, low-dose doxorubicin, and broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal medication were given to patient, but despite all these therapies, the patient did not survive. In contrast, in our case, initially the patient developed a hepatic nodular lesion after two months, and later after six months, skin lesions appeared.The management of KS includes treatment with chemotherapy according to disease severity and disseminated visceral involvement [3], reduction, change, or discontinuation of immunosuppressant agents which showed significant improvement in our case. However, the skin and mucous membranes lesions in the current patient also responded well to topical treatments in addition to Sirolimus. The current patient was not treated by the withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy as the antitumor kinase inhibitors such as Sirolimus have anti-Kaposi sarcoma effects [19]. Furthermore, Sirolimus can be used in the treatment of cutaneous KS in post-solid organ transplant patients [3]. Consistent with the current positive outcome, children with post-HSCT Kaposi sarcoma have a good prognosis despite visceral involvement. For example, mortality was 11% in children and 48% in adults in the Cesaro series and literature review [7].  4. ConclusionsIn conclusion, Kaposi sarcoma with visceral involvement is a rare secondary malignancy in the pediatric population after haploidentical HSCT as compared to solid organ transplant. The delay in diagnosis and delayed treatment can lead to increased mortality. Therefore, we present this case report to emphasize the importance of suspecting Kaposi sarcoma in patients post-HSCT. The unexpected involvement of the liver was initially misdiagnosed as a fungal infection but was suspected after the appearance of skin lesions. Despite visceral involvement, the patient responded well to topical treatment and systemic antitumor kinase inhibitors. The findings underscore the importance of keeping Kaposi sarcoma in the differential diagnosis of post-HSCT complications.

Angiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive subtype of soft-tissue sarcoma with a propensity for local recurrence and metastasis associated with a generally poor prognosis, unless diagnosed early. Given the vascular endothelial cell origin of angiosarcoma, tumours may develop in essentially any organ; however, there is a predilection for the skin where half of all tumours arise, increasing in prevalence with age. The most common risk factors are chronic lymphoedema and history of radiation. We review the most important radiological findings along the spectrum of angiosarcoma from head to toe throughout the body, including uncommon and rare locations. Key imaging features of angiosarcoma across multiple organ systems will be described, as well as the impact on management and prognosis.

        Abstract



Purpose of review¬†
The present review aims to provide readers with the latest updates on the biology and clinical management of cutaneous angiosarcoma (cAS).
Recent findings¬†
The genomic alteration of cAS is heterogeneous. Mutations are enriched in the mitosis-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway. Functional analysis has identified molecules that may serve as potential markers and therapeutic targets of angiosarcoma. These molecules include survivin, HSP90, FOXM1, miR-497-5p, KCa3.1, and miR210.
This body of knowledge has not yet transferred to clinical practice. The mainstay of treatment for cAS remains surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy. The efficacy of paclitaxel as an adjuvant chemotherapy is suggested.
For patients with advanced cAS, paclitaxel is the treatment of choice. There are also second-line treatment options that are supported by evidence of varying strength. A multikinase inhibitor, pazopanib, has been assessed in several studies, most of which support its efficacy for angiosarcoma. Bevacizumab monotherapy may be effective for angiosarcoma. The efficacy of eribulin mesylate and trabectedin for angiosarcoma is currently being assessed. Recent publications highlighted the role of the immune system in the biology of cAS.
Summary¬†
Future research efforts should focus on the following aspects of cAS: drug development directed at recent molecular targets, clinical trials designed specifically for patients with cAS, and the role of immunotherapy for cAS.


INTRODUCTION
Cutaneous angiosarcoma (cAS) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma (STS) with abysmal prognosis. cAS follows an aggressive course, with early propensity for metastasis. A major challenge physicians face when treating cAS is a sheer lack of information. Because angiosarcoma represents 2% of STSs, which occurs at the rate of two to five cases per 1 000 000 per year, limited information is available to physicians [1,2]. In this article, we review key articles on the biology and treatment of cAS, with an emphasis on recent publications.
There are several disease classifications that are used interchangeably in describing angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma is often classified into cAS and visceral angiosarcoma according to the primary site of the tumor. Many consider cardiac angiosarcoma to be a distinct disease entity. Angiosarcoma is further classified into primary angiosarcoma and secondary angiosarcoma. Secondary angiosarcoma is usually related to a history of radiation treatment and chronic lymphedema. Therefore, secondary angiosarcoma is often termed ‚Äòradiation-associated angiosarcoma (RAAS)‚Äô in the first scenario, or Stewart‚ÄìTreves syndrome in the latter [3,4]. The term, ‚Äòbreast angiosarcoma‚Äô encompasses both cutaneous and noncutaneous lesions whose cause is presumably secondary. In this review, we focus our discussion mainly on primary, cAS.¬†Box 1: no caption availableBIOLOGY
During the last 10 years, our knowledge of cancer genomics has expanded owing to advancements in high throughput sequencing technologies and sophisticated computational biology techniques. We now know that angiosarcoma is a very complex, heterogeneous group of tumors (Table 1). The seminal paper by Behjati et al.[5] identified that protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type B (PTPRB), and phospholipase C, gamma 1 (PLCG1) are recurrently mutated in angiosarcoma. Their work is the largest and most comprehensive effort to characterize mutations in angiosarcoma to date. A potential caveat of their study is that the key mutations are rather uncommon; the frequency of mutations in PTPRB and PLCG1 are 26% and 9%, respectively. These mutations explain oncogenesis in a fraction of patients with angiosarcoma.Table 1: Reported genomic abnormalities in angiosarcomaAn interesting study by Shimozono et al.[7] used RNA-seq to discover a fusion gene transcript that may confer growth advantage to the cells. They identified the NUP160-SLC43A3 fusion gene from an angiosarcoma cell line, ISO-HAS. They further confirmed that NUP160 truncation confers growth advantage using a mouse xenograft model. Murali et al.[6] used targeted panels to identify the enrichment of mutations in known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Notably, their study reported the enrichment of mutations in the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. They identified numerous mutations including KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MAPK1, and NF1. The role of H-RAS in angiosarcoma pathogenesis is supported by a study using a cAS cell culture system [8]. It is important to note that the frequency of each mutation identified in the genomic studies ranges between 5 and 35%. These genomic studies illustrate the complexity and heterogeneity of the angiosarcoma genome; finding a few unifying driver events in cAS is unlikely. It is conceivable that a one-size-fits-all approach for the treatment of cAS is unfruitful. In light of advancing clinical sequencing technologies, patients with cAS are likely to benefit from personalized, precision medicine.
Recent studies have focused on the functional aspects of cAS, and some have identified potential drug targets. Tsuneki et al.[9‚ñ™] showed that survivin is a potential marker and therapeutic target for cAS. They demonstrated that survivin is overexpressed in cAS, but not in hemangioma or pyrogenic granuloma. They further showed that the growth of ISO-HAS is inhibited by survivin siRNA constructs and the survivin inhibitor molecule. Ito et al.[10] found that forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) serves as a prognostic marker for patients with cAS, and is a candidate drug target. Yamada-Kanazawa et al.[11] highlighted the role of heat shock protein (HSP) 90 in cAS. They used various cAS cell lines to show that HSP90 inhibition suppresses the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cAS cells.
microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation has been gaining attention in recent studies. Chen et al.[12‚ñ™] observed miR-497-5p downregulation in five cases of human angiosarcoma, but not in capillary hemangioma samples. Using ISO-HAS cell culture and a mouse xenograft model, they showed that miR-497-5p regulates KCa3.1, which promotes the proliferation, inhibition, and invasion of ISO-HAS cell lines. Nakashima et al.[13] reported that miR-210, a miRNA implicated in other cancer types, is downregulated in cAS. They further showed that E2F3 and ephrin A3, the putative targets of miR-210, regulate cell proliferation in angiosarcoma cell culture. These studies provide invaluable insights into the pathology of cAS. Some of them also suggest potential drug targets for cAS and may spawn future research on drug development.
PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE DISEASE
The prognosis of patients with cAS is abysmal, and publications have recently reiterated this problem in greater depth. A recent meta-analysis provides the most reliable statistics on patients with cAS [14‚ñ™‚ñ™]. The pooled analysis showed that the mean 5-year survival rate of patients with angiosarcoma was 33.5%. Their analysis identified age more than 70 years, tumor greater than 5 cm in size, and angiosarcoma of the head as predictors of poor prognosis.
Although our understanding of the biology of cAS has advanced considerably, these findings have not yet transferred to clinical practice. The standard of care for patients with cAS remains surgical resection with or without postoperative radiation therapy. A recent report assessing 764 case records retrospectively found that only surgery, but not radiotherapy or chemotherapy, is correlated with improved survival [15]. In their meta-analysis, Shin et al.[14‚ñ™‚ñ™] found that surgery improves the 5-year survival rate compared with other treatments [odds ratio (OR) = 4.369; P = .002]. Sinnamon et al.[16] found that positive resection margins are associated with worse overall survival (OS). Curative surgery should always be considered for patients with cAS.
cAS is associated with a high chance of recurrence even after complete resection of the tumor. In their retrospective analysis, Fujisawa et al.[17] showed that maintenance therapy with taxane is effective for patients who underwent surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy. At our institute, we treat cAS with surgery when feasible, and also consider postoperative radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy.
Patients with unresectable or metastatic disease require systemic treatments (Table 2). Clinical trials assessing the systemic treatments for cAS are scarce. Traditionally, doxorubicin-based chemotherapy has been the treatment of choice for advanced STS. The efficacy of doxorubicin for cAS has, however, only been assessed in retrospective studies, and the value of doxorubicin in the treatment of cAS thus remains unclear [26]. We do not routinely use doxorubicin as a first-line therapy to treat patients with cAS at our institution. Instead, we favor paclitaxel as the treatment of choice for advanced cAS. The efficacy of paclitaxel treatment was rigorously assessed in a phase II trial enrolling 30 patients with unresectable or metastatic angiosarcoma [18]. The nonprogression rate at 2 and 4 months was 74 and 42%, respectively. Paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab was tested in a randomized phase II trial [19]. The study found that both paclitaxel with and without bevacizumab were supported as active treatment regimens, although they did not find a benefit of adding bevacizumab. Overall, solid lines of evidence support the use of paclitaxel as a first-line therapy for treatment of advanced cAS.Table 2: Systemic treatments for cutaneous angiosarcomaA microtubule-targeting agent, eribulin mesylate, was originally approved for the treatment of breast cancer by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2010 [27]. Eribulin mesylate was later reported to be effective in studies enrolling patients with advanced STS, although neither of the studies included patients with angiosarcoma [2,28]. In response to these findings, eribulin mesylate was approved in Japan for the treatment of ‚Äòmalignant sarcoma‚Äô, and eribulin mesylate is therefore covered for patients with cAS in Japan [29‚ñ™]. A recent case report from Japan described an patient with angiosarcoma whose disease was controlled successfully with eribulin mesylate [23‚ñ™]. A multicenter, prospective study assessing the efficacy of eribulin to cAS is ongoing in Japan (UMIN000023331).
A histone deacetylase inhibitor, trabectedin, has been used in phase II trials enrolling various patients with STS. Most of these trials do not include patients with angiosarcoma. A French retrospective study, however, analyzed a cohort of 885 patients with STS, including nine patients with angiosarcoma [24]. They found only marginal activity of trabectedin given to cAS patients; the 3-month progression free survival (PFS) rate was 25%. We consider that the use of trabectedin should be reserved for patients with cAS whose treatment options have been exhausted.
Bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor, has been studied in the context of combination therapy and monotherapy. Considering the antiangiogenic property of bevacizumab, it is natural to assume that bevacizumab may be effective for the treatment of cAS. In fact, a phase II study found that bevacizumab as a monotherapy is effective for angiosarcoma, with a mean time-to-progression of 26 weeks [21]. A bevacizumab plus paclitaxel regimen did not, however, offer additional benefit over paclitaxel monotherapy in a phase II study, probably because of the overt toxicity of the combination regimen [19]. We consider that bevacizumab as a monotherapy is an attractive option for the second-line treatment of cAS.
Recently, there have been mixed reports on the activity of pazopanib for the treatment of cAS. The PALETTE study, a large phase III study enrolling 372 patients with STS of various histological subtypes showed the efficacy of a multityrosine kinase inhibitor, pazopanib [30]. The PALETTE study did not, however, address whether pazopanib is effective for cAS. Koll√°r et al. retrospectively assessed 40 patients with angiosarcoma treated with pazopanib. Median PFS and median OS were 3 and 9.9 months, respectively [20‚ñ™‚ñ™]. Another study from Japan reported a PFS of 94 days for patients with cAS treated with pazopanib [31]. These numbers are in line with those from the PALETTE study, showing the value of pazopanib for the treatment of cAS. By analyzing eight patients with cAS treated with pazopanib, Kitamura et al.[32] showed, however, that there was no significant difference in OS between patients with cAS treated with and without pazopanib. We consider pazopanib as one of the second-line treatment options for cAS, because Kitamura et al.'s study is felt underpowered to reliably discredit the efficacy of pazopanib. The Dermatologic Oncology Group, a division of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG), are planning a phase II study assessing the efficacy of pazopanib for treatment of patients with advanced cAS in Japan.
Aside from chemotherapy and molecular-targeted therapies, the role of propranolol in treating patients with cAS has been suggested. Propranolol is a nonselective Œ≤-adrenergic receptor blocker that is widely used for treating hypertension and chronic heart failure. Propranolol was serendipitously found to inhibit the growth of infantile hemangioma [33]. Since this discovery, there has been mounting evidence showing the efficacy of propranolol on infantile hemangioma [34,35]. Furthermore, propranolol was found to suppress cancer metastasis in several cancer types [36]. Based on these findings, Chow et al.[37] showed that oral propranolol monotherapy was effective in an patient with advanced angiosarcoma whose tumor was positive for Œ≤-adrenergic receptors ADRB1, ADRB2, and ADRB3. Propranolol has been tested in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents such as vinblastine and cyclophosphamide [22‚ñ™,38]. There is not enough evidence to make any recommendations regarding the use of propranolol for treatment of patients with angiosarcoma at this point. Considering its wide availability, low cost, and favorable safety profile, however, propranolol may be a promising treatment alternative for patients with angiosarcoma.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The field of cancer immunology has grown rapidly since the introduction of new generations of immune checkpoint inhibitors. At present, there is no immunotherapy approved for cAS. There have, however, been studies linking the immune system to angiosarcoma. Shimizu et al.[39] found that programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression is inversely correlated with the prognosis of patients with cAS. Our work has shown somewhat conflicting results; we have demonstrated that PD-L1 expression at the tumor site, and the number of PD-1-positive infiltrating cells are positive prognostic markers of patients with cAS [40]. The reason for the discrepancy is unclear at this point. Nonetheless, these two studies show that the immune system plays a role in the progression of cAS, although the value of PD-L1 positivity as a prognostic marker remains unclear. One surprising case report described a remarkable response to anti-PD-1 treatment in a patient with angiosarcoma, although the patient experienced drug-induced hepatitis that necessitated systemic corticosteroid treatment [25‚ñ™]. There is only one prospective study on the role of immunotherapy in the treatment of angiosarcoma; a phase II trial found that PD-1 inhibition had limited activity in 57 patients with STS, including one patient with angiosarcoma [41]. This study is too underpowered, to draw any conclusions from on the role of immunotherapy in the treatment of angiosarcoma. A phase II study to assess the efficacy of a combination immunotherapy is currently enrolling patients with advanced sarcoma in the United States (NCT02815995). This study is projected to enroll a proportion of patients with angiosarcoma.
CONCLUSION
Advances in basic research have unveiled genomic alterations characteristic of angiosarcoma. This knowledge has not yet transferred to clinical practice. Paclitaxel is the mainstay of the systemic treatment for unresectable or metastatic cAS. Studies have shown the activity of eribulin mesylate and, to a lesser extent, trabectedin. Propranolol is an emerging treatment modality with a favorable safety profile. Studies have shed light on the role of the immune system in patients with cAS. Preliminary reports show that patients with angiosarcoma may benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy. Larger research efforts to clarify the role of immune checkpoint therapy in angiosarcoma are urgently needed.

AbstractPurpose of reviewMucosal melanoma is of great interest due to its aggressive behavior and less favorable prognosis. The literature is mainly case reports and case series. Here, we will collect the knowledge on mucosal melanoma from the last decade and review the literature. The main focus is being site-specific clinical features, treatment, and prognosis.Recent findingsThe use of immunotherapy gain ground as for others subsets of melanoma. Anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 blockade in mucosal melanoma have been evaluated in recent studies. Clinical trials are ongoing.SummaryThe etiology of mucosal melanomas remains unknown. Head and neck mucosal melanomas are most common. Wide excision surgery is the treatment of choice. The effect of adjuvant therapy on survival remains questionable due to the limited knowledge. Radiotherapy seems to give better local control. The overall five-year survival rate for mucosal melanomas is 0‚Äì45%. Recent data indicates that this may be improved by the immunotherapy in the years to come.

Judson-Torres5,6Hanlin Zeng1,2*1Department of Oncology, Ninth People‚Äôs Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China2Shanghai Institute of Precision Medicine, Shanghai, China3Department of Oral Pathology, Ninth People‚Äôs Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China4Department of Oral & Maxillofacial - Head and Neck Oncology, Ninth People‚Äôs Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China5Department of Dermatology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States6Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT, United StatesMucosal melanoma (MM) is a rare melanoma subtype that originates from melanocytes within sun-protected mucous membranes. Compared with cutaneous melanoma (CM), MM has worse prognosis and lacks effective treatment options. Moreover, the endogenous or exogenous risk factors that influence mucosal melanocyte transformation, as well as the identity of MM precursor lesions, are ambiguous. Consequently, there remains a lack of molecular markers that can be used for early diagnosis, and therefore better management, of MM. In this review, we first summarize the main functions of mucosal melanocytes. Then, using oral mucosal melanoma (OMM) as a model, we discuss the distinct pathologic stages from benign mucosal melanocytes to metastatic MM, mapping the possible evolutionary trajectories that correspond to MM initiation and progression. We highlight key areas of ambiguity during the genetic evolution of MM from its benign lesions, and the resolution of which could aid in the discovery of new biomarkers for MM detection and diagnosis. We outline the key pathways that are altered in MM, including the MAPK pathway, the PI3K/AKT pathway, cell cycle regulation, telomere maintenance, and the RNA maturation process, and discuss targeted therapy strategies for MM currently in use or under investigation.IntroductionMelanoma develops due to the unchecked proliferation of melanocytes, which are responsible for the production of pigment. About 90% of melanoma cases are cutaneous melanoma (CM) mainly induced by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light (1). Non-cutaneous subtypes include uveal melanoma (UM) and mucosal melanoma (MM). MM is a rare type of melanoma that presents on mucosal surfaces of cavities within the body, including the oral, nasal, anorectal, genitourinary, and vulvovaginal region (2). Although MM makes up approximately 1% of all cases of melanoma, it is one of the most aggressive subtypes, and thus exhibits a worse prognosis compared with the common CM (3, 4). Based on a retrospective study, the 5-year survival rate of MM, considering all stages at the time of diagnosis, is 10-20% when compared to 93% for CM (4‚Äì6).There are several possible reasons for this worse prognosis in MM: 1) Both the biology of mucosal melanocytes as well as the risk factors that are related to MM incidence are poorly understood. Exposure to UV is a well-established risk factor for CM but the mutagens that contribute to the development of MM remain unknown. According to epidemiological studies, smoking, ill-fitting dentures, and ingested/inhaled carcinogens such as tobacco and formaldehyde are regarded as potential causative factors for oral and sinonasal mucosal melanoma (2, 7), while chronic inflammatory disease, viral infections as well as chemical irritants are thought to be implicated in vulvar mucosal melanoma and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with anorectal mucosal melanoma (2). However, the contributions and mechanisms of the aforementioned factors to MM initiation or progression are not clearly defined. 2) The evolution of MM from precursor lesions is poorly understood. CM is associated with different types of precursor lesions, including benign melanocytic nevi commonly associated with the BRAF V600E mutation and dysplastic nevi associated NRAS alterations and TERT promoter mutations (8). CM can evolve from these benign lesions following additional mutations that drive tumor invasion and metastasis such as loss of CDKN2A, PTEN, or TP53 (9). Characterization of the morphology and molecular landscape of precursors compared to early melanoma has provided candidate molecular biomarkers for early diagnosis in CM (10‚Äì13). However, although several forms of mucosal melanocytic benign lesions are reported, there is still a lack of defined MM precursor lesions, leading to a weak understanding of the evolutionary trajectory of MM despite molecular profiles unveiled by recent whole-genome sequencing data (14‚Äì16). 3) MM has more diverse mutation patterns with fewer targetable mutations compared to CM. According to the most frequent and mutually exclusive mutations, CM is mainly classified into 4 genomic subtypes: BRAF(52%), RAS(31%), NF1(14%), and a small portion of triple wild-type (17, 18). Hence, co-targeting BRAF and MEK have been proved to achieve a significant response rate for BRAF V600 mutated CM patients in clinical management (19, 20). In contrast, MM has more diverse mutation patterns, with less than 20% of BRAFV600E mutations (16), followed by the majority of mutations that are scattered and difficult to target, including NRAS, NF1, KIT, SF3B1, and SPRED1 (21).Our goals in conducting this review were to: 1) Summarize the types of mucosal melanocytic benign lesions, aiming to find possible genetic and pathological evolutional patterns from benign mucosal melanocytes lesions to malignant tumors; 2) Discuss the main driver mutations and pathways in MM; and 3) Outline the options of targeted treatment for MM in clinical use or under clinical trials.Biological Functions of MelanocytesMelanocytes are neural crest-derived cells that migrate to specific anatomic locations - including skin, eyes, leptomeninges, and mucous membrane - during development. Cutaneous melanocytes have two final destinations: hair follicles and the basal cell layer of epithelium where they conduct their main biological function of melanin production (22, 23). Melanin is a natural pigment in skin that absorbs UV radiation and scavenges cytotoxic free radicals generated from sunlight exposure (23, 24). Synthesized melanin is secreted to the nearby keratinocytes under solar stimulation and protects the genome of keratinocytes from sun damage (25).In addition to residing in the skin, melanocytes also dwell in many sun-shielded mucosal tissues like respiratory (oral, nasal, pharynx, larynx, and upper esophagus), intestinal, urogenital, and rectal tracts (2, 24, 26‚Äì28). As melanocytes located in mucous membranes are not usually directly exposed to sunlight, it is unlikely that photoprotection is the primary and definitive function of mucosal melanocytes. It was hypothesized that melanocytes localized to mucosal tissues due to errors of migration from the neural crest during embryogenesis (6, 26), but recent evidence suggests that mucosal melanocytes might have biological functions besides pigment production. Specifically, since mucosa plays an important role in the innate immune defense system, it is speculated that mucosal melanocytes are also equipped with immunogenic functions (23, 29).It is reported that melanin has strong toxin binding properties that can neutralize toxins produced by bacteria (30). Meanwhile, aromatic precursors, including quinone and semiquinone intermediates generated during the melanization cascade, can disrupt the lipid bilayer of cell membranes of microorganisms and mediate an anti-bacterial effect (31, 32). The strong binding capacity of melanin is probably due to its specific graphite-like lamellar structure in which four to eight monomers are covalently bound to form a porphyrin-like system (33). As a result, melanin is able to interact with aromatic metabolites or compositions of microorganisms through hydrogen bonds or¬†œÄ-œÄ interactions (34, 35). Another explanation for the anti-bacterial properties of melanin and its intermediates is that they contain high levels of redox-active catechol groups, which can produce reactive oxygen species under light and water stimulation (36). However, since the mucosal melanocytes are in a dark environment with marginal melanin production, it remains unknown whether the pigment levels in mucosal regions are sufficient for antimicrobial effects.In addition to the anti-bacterial properties of melanin, melanocytes can also participate in the intrinsic and acquired immune system. On the one hand, melanocytes can participate in innate immunity since they are found to express Toll-like receptors, indicating melanocytes can recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns present in microbes (37, 38). Once being recognized, bacteria and fungi can be engulfed by melanocytes ‚Äì a phenomenon that has been observed under the microscope - before undergoing possible degradation pathways by lysosome hydrolytic enzymes contained in melanosomes (39, 40). On the other hand, melanocytes may be a component of acquired immunity. Melanocytes have been reported to express MHC class II loaded with mycobacterial peptides (41), suggesting that melanocytes may function as antigen-presenting cells and subsequently activate CD4+ T cells proliferation (42). Although the phagocytotic functions of melanocytes have been observed, the activation of T cells through antigen presented by melanocytes, for instance, should be further verified by investigating the expression of CD86, CD80, or other markers of antigen-presenting cells on the surface of melanocytes. Since melanocytes have the capacity to produce a variety of cytokines, including interleukins and interferons which may be involved in the regulation of the activity of neighboring immune cells under stimulations of exogenous nucleic acids (43‚Äì47), the hypothesis that melanocytes activate T cells through secreting specific cytokines, instead of acting as antigen-presenting cells, must also be tested. These collective observations suggest melanocytes likely participate to some extent in the immune defense of the body, but their precise immunological roles in the innate or adaptive immune system need to be dissected in further studies.Mucosal Melanocytic Benign LesionsStudies in the pathologic evolution of CM have shown that invasive melanomas can evolve from a variety of benign and intermediate pathological stages including benign nevus, dysplastic nevus, and malignant tumor in situ (8, 9). Melanocytic nevi are benign lesions requiring no further treatment, while atypical melanocytic hyperplasia or atypical nevi are regarded as either indeterminant or premalignant lesions that warrant careful clinical management and long-term follow-up for patients. In contrast, there is no clear definition and characterization of precursor lesions of MM despite the fact that multiple mucosal melanocytic benign lesions are observed and documented in the clinic (Figures 1A, B). Using OMM as the most well-studied example, Table¬†1 summarizes several benign pigmented lesions including macule, nevus, and melanocanthoma with their specific pathological characteristics.TABLE¬†1

 

Table¬†1 Comparison of benign lesions and malignant oral mucosal melanoma.Melanotic Macule of the Oral MucosaMelanotic macules are one of the most common melanocytic lesions (48, 49) and lentigo simplex is the term used to describe a group of small and round macules (50). The color of macules varies from gray to brown to black. The diversity of pigmentation is thought to be associated with the ratio of eumelanin and pheomelanin (23, 24). Macules are usually regarded as benign lesions since the causative factor of macules is melanin deposition and no Ki-67 positive melanocytes are observed (51, 52). Hence, the diameter of the pigmented lesions is usually less than 1¬†cm, and their morphology is flat, solitary, and well-circumscribed (Figure¬†1A). From histological examinations, the basal cell layer of benign macules is exhibited with uniform melanin accumulation without an increase in the density of melanocytes or the presence of nevus (Figures¬†1E, F). These lesions are asymptomatic and no malignant transformation is reported at this stage. The most frequently observed site for macules in the oral cavity is the vermillion border of the lip at the rate of 30% followed by the gingiva and alveolar ridge (23%), and the buccal (16%) or labial mucosa (9%) (24). Interestingly, the hard palate, which is one of the most common locations for OMM has less chance for macule occurrence (7%) (24). Although there is no evidence that melanotic macules are directly associated with the eventual diagnosis of MM in oral mucosa, some published case reports have recorded the transformation of benign macules to malignant OMM after years of diagnosis (53‚Äì55), suggesting the malignant potential of some macular lesions to be considered as precursor lesions. As Ki-67 staining is not routinely requested in the diagnosis of melanotic macules, it is unclear what percentage of lesions contain proliferating melanocytes and may possess malignancy potentiality.FIGURE¬†1

Ulcerated malignant MM on the hard palate (D) and its HE staining pictures (O, P).Oral Mucosal NevusOral nevi are much less common than their counterparts on the skin and their prevalence is about 0.1% in the general population (24). Subepithelial lesions are the most common oral mucosal nevi (55%), followed by blue nevi in submucosal‚Äìmucosal junction (Figures¬†1I, J) (36%), and junctional nevi are the least frequent ones (3%) (7, 56). According to the histologic location of melanocytes, oral nevi can be divided into three categories: junctional nevi (Figures¬†1K, L) at the tip of the widened and elongated epithelial spikes; compound nevi arranged in nests and belts in the lamina propria; and subepithelial nevi (Figures¬†1B, G, H) entirely in the subepithelial connective tissue. The formation of nevi in oral mucosa results from the proliferation of melanocytes along with the epithelial basal cell layer, but most are relatively small with a mean diameter of 0.5cm. Similar to macules, nevi harbor clear borders. However, instead of being flat, more than 50% of nevi are elevated pigmented lesions. In addition, about 15% of oral nevi are non-pigmented and the mechanism behind the lack of pigmentation remains unclear (24). From the histopathological point of view, the appearance of nevus cells along epithelial spikes is polygonal and epithelioid. Typical nevus cells have uniformly round or oval nuclei and contain sparse, uniform, and small melanin granules in the cytoplasm. As for nevus cells in the deeper subepithelial tissue, they become smaller with less cytoplasm and dense and deeply stained nucleus-like lymphocytes.Although there is a lack of case reports unequivocally documenting the transformation of benign nevi to malignant tumors in the oral cavity, the risk of malignancy in some oral nevi cannot be excluded. The deficiency of case reports is partially due to the rare individuals with congenital or acquired nevi and short follow-up periods of objects (57). A clinicopathologic analysis shows that five out of seven OMM patients have junctional nevi, therefore some clinicians recommend a complete excisional biopsy to rule out early OMM for individuals with junctional nevi (58). In addition, nowadays the classification of nevi is mainly based on their histologic positions and lacks criteria based on the degree of malignancy. Only the appearance of dysplastic nevi is considered as an increased risk of melanoma (59‚Äì61). Dysplastic nevi are usually larger than normal nevi with macular or popular components and ill-defined borders (62). The current diagnosis of dysplastic nevi mainly depends on their architectural disorder rather than specific biomarkers, which heavily relies on the experience of pathologists and causes a relatively high rate of misdiagnosis. Hence, more refined diagnostic criteria and more sensitive biomarkers are needed clinically to find potential precancerous nevi.MelanoacanthomaMelanoacanthoma is a rare form of benign melanotic lesion characterized by benign proliferation of both keratinocytes and melanocytes (24, 63). Microscopic examination can detect the hyperplastic keratinocytes, while positive immunostainings of HMB-45 and S-100 prove the presence of melanocytes abnormal accumulation (64). Compared with macule and nevus, this benign entity is much rarer but may mimic OMM due to its rapid increase in size with diameters of several centimeters being reached in just a few weeks. The lesion is usually flat or slightly raised and most commonly occurs on the buccal mucosa. Histopathologic examination shows many dendritic melanocytes and processes containing melanin in all strata of epithelium. Besides, melanophagocytes, mild lymphocyte infiltration, as well as vasodilation are seen in the lamina proporia. Similar to other benign lesions, once the melanoacanthoma is diagnosed, the site is usually just monitored, as these lesions are highly likely to regress within 2 to 6 months after biopsy (65, 66). However, if a melanoacanthoma enlarges in a very short period of time, it may indicate a sign of malignancy (67). A more comprehensive understanding of what drives mucosal melanocyte proliferation as well as the regression in melanoacanthoma, and how the fast-growing melanoacanthoma transforms into MM, is needed.Oral macule, nevus, and melanoacanthoma are usually diagnosed as benign lesions, but periodical physical examinations and biopsies of those melanocytic lesions are still recommended because approximately one-third of OMM patients are found to present benign pigmented lesions prior to the emergence of the malignant state (67‚Äì69). Additionally, our collaborating clinicians and pathologists at Shanghai Ninth People‚Äôs Hospital have observed the development of hyperpigmentations adjacent to OMM in a majority of patients and they suspect that tumors expand through those de novo pigmented lesions (Figures¬†1D). Based on the above findings, we propose that a subgroup of benign lesions, especially macules, possess the potential to transform to OMM. If true, identification of biomarkers for those cancer-predisposing lesions coupled with more radical surgical excision may improve the outcome of patients. To achieve this goal, a thorough genetic evolution study sequencing not only malignant MMs but also benign lesions and suspected premalignant lesions is needed. Assessment of the genetic evolution of benign and malignant MM subtypes may reveal markers of increased risk of malignant transformation to aid in early diagnosis and clinical management.Mucosal MelanomaOMM is one of the most frequent and well-studied MM subtypes. The preferred site for OMM (Figure¬†1D) is the keratinized mucosa, including the hard palate and maxillary gingiva where the masticatory stress is focused (70). Symptoms include pain, ulceration, bleeding, loose teeth, bone erosion, etc. (71, 72). The MM shows variable color from black to red or white accompanied with asymmetric and irregular morphology (73). Contrasting from CM, which is commonly diagnosed in the radial growth phase, OMM is usually first identified in a vertical growth phase with 30% of lesions at an invasive stage, and 55% of lesions at a combined invasive and in situ stage (7). Also different from CM, MM lacks a clear classification system for subtypes of lesions. Based on the histopathologic patterns and levels of solar damage, there are several different categorization methods for CM (74), whereas the subclassification of MM remains controversial. Currently, it is simply divided into MM in situ, invasive MM, and MM with a mixed pattern. The observing surface architecture of MM ranges from macular to ulcerated and nodular (75). Lentigo maligna melanoma (Figure¬†1C) is regarded as one form of OMM in situ as it shares similar histopathological traits as typical OMM in situ (Figures¬†1M, N). From the microscopic perspective, OMM consists of diverse morphological melanocytes including epithelioid, spindle, and plasmacytoid, which typically have a large, vesicular nucleus with prominent nucleoli (Figures¬†1O, P). They are usually aggregated into sheets or alveolar groups and less commonly neurotropic or desmoplastic configurations are observed. Most of the tumors contain melanin, while only a small proportion is amelanotic (76). As for immunohistochemical features of OMM, there is no single immunohistochemical marker that invariantly identifies all OMM. A variable expression of S-100, Melan-A, MITF, tyrosinase, and HMB-45 has been reported (27, 28, 49, 76). SOX 10 is a new marker, showing high sensitivity (positive in 88-100% of OMM cases) but moderate specificity in MM (77, 78). Hence, identification of biomarkers for OMM with better test characteristics of needed to achieve a consistent accurate diagnosis of MM and its initial lesions.Mutations and Signaling Pathway Dependency in MMTo date, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) has revealed the genomic profile of MM and pinpointed reoccurring aberrant genes that potentially drive the evolution of melanocytes to malignant tumors in the mucosal membrane. In contrast to CM, MM harbors a low single nucleotide mutation burden, but a high number of chromosomal structural variants (16, 79). BRAF and NRAS mutations, which are widely present in CM, are less frequent in MM (16, 79). Instead, activating mutations in SF3B1 and KIT, loss of CDKN2A, PTEN, or SPRED1, as well as amplification of CDK4, TERT, KIT, MDM2, or CCND1, are more common in MM (16). Table¬†2 compares the genetic profile between CM and MM. The data for altered genes in CM are average from Akbani‚Äôs and Hayward‚Äôs papers (17, 79), while the figures for MM are obtained from Newell‚Äôs paper (16). Figure¬†2 summarizes the frequency of alterations in possible driver genes based upon WGS data of 67 frozen tumors (16). Those mutated genes correspond to specific cellular pathways that are potentially highly dependent on the initiation and progression of MM, providing potentially effective targets for combined treatment in the clinic.FIGURE¬†2

Table¬†2 Comparison of genetic profiles MM and CM.KIT Signaling PathwayC-KIT is a receptor tyrosine kinase located on the membrane of various cell types. The stimulation of the C-KIT receptor by its extracellular ligand leads to downstream activation of the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades that play an important role in proliferation, survival, and motility of melanoma cells (80). There is a high prevalence of KIT gain-of-function alterations including missense mutation and copy number amplification in patients with MM at rates of 15% and 21% respectively (16), while the corresponding figures in CM are only 3.7% and 4.2% separately (17, 79). MMs with KIT mutations presumably affect the function of juxta-membrane autoinhibitory domain (JMD) (W557R, N566D, V559A, V559D, V560D, V569G, P573L, L576P, K642E) and tyrosine kinase domains (D816H, D820Y, A829P, N822K), causing constitutive activation of C-KIT-regulated pathways (81‚Äì84). Among the aforementioned mutations, K642E is the most frequently observed in MM. Although codon 642 is located out of the JMD, amino acid aberrations in this position are thought to destabilize the JMD through amino acid interactions (81). Besides WGS and WES data, immunohistochemistry images show increased protein expression of C-KIT in all in situ MMs and nearly 90% of invasive tissues in a cohort of 18 cases (85), indicating the strengthening of the C-KIT signaling pathway. Compared to CM, the gain-of-function alterations of KIT are more common not only in MM but also in acral melanoma (AM) (86). Although the mechanism explaining why C-KIT is pathogenetically important in sun-protected melanomas remains poorly understood, it does not prevent the protein from being a potentially effective therapeutic target and a series of C-KIT inhibitors are currently under pre-clinical and clinical investigations (82, 87‚Äì89).RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK MAP Kinases PathwayStimulation of C-KIT or other receptor tyrosine kinase on the cellular membrane by extracellular growth factors provokes downstream activation of RAS and RAF kinases followed by phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, leading to activation of the MAPK pathway implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (90). NRAS and BRAF both play a part in the MAPK pathway, which are thought to contribute to melanoma development.NRAS activating mutations are prevalent in CM at 29% (17, 79), while the mutation frequency in MM is only 18% (16). Furthermore, nearly 90% of NRAS missense mutations occur at codon 61 in CM, compared to 54% for MM. The remaining 46% of mutations are located at codon 12 and codon 13 (91). Compared with NRAS activating mutations at positions 12 and 13, NRAS Q61 mutations exert a stronger activating effect on the MAPK pathway since codon 61 is the catalytic residue for GTP hydrolysis and Q61 mutation impedes the return of RAS to an inactive GDP-bound state (92). For both CM and MM, Q61R and Q61K are the most commonly detected amino acid transitions at codon 61. Similarly, the most common mutations for both types of melanoma at codon 13 are G13D and G13R, although G13R is predominant in CM and G13D in MM (93).BRAF is a serine-threonine kinase involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. Over 50% of CM cases report activating mutation of the BRAF gene (17, 79), while merely 16% of MMs experience the same alteration (16). In addition to harboring common active mutations, BRAF is distinct from NRAS in MM in that the locus undergoes amplification in 13% of cases (16). Mutations in the BRAF gene are missense mutations and they most frequently occur at codon 600, the activating loop, where amino acids change from valine to glutamic acid (V600E) (93). Besides the activation loop (A-loop), the second most common site for amino acid substitutions is the GSGSFG phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) at residues 464-469 (94). The activity of BRAF kinase is regulated by the interaction formed between A-loop and P-loop, thus mutations in either A-loop or P-loop disrupt the interaction and cause hyperactivation of the kinase (93, 95). In CM, more than 90% of mutations are present on the V600 codon, whereas in MM only 63% are V600 mutations, with the remainder (37%) on the G469, D594, and K601 codons (91, 93). In other words, MM not only has far less frequent BRAF missense mutations but also has more diverse locations for BRAF mutations as compared to CM. However, similar to CM there is nearly no coincidence of NRAS and BRAF missense mutations, suggesting functionally redundant NRAS and BRAF mutations in MM despite more variable mutational locations.Although the contribution of mutant NRAS and BRAF to MM progression appears to be less common than melanoma of the skin, more components in the MAPK pathway of MM tend to undergo mutations or copy number changes, rendering inhibition of MAPK signaling transduction more challenging. The NF1 gene, for example, encodes neurofibromin 1 protein, a negative regulator of Ras proteins, and can lose its function in both CM and MM. NF1 mutation rates are 16% in MM (16) and 15% in CM (17, 79), suggesting NF1 plays a pivotal role in the biology of both types of melanoma. Loss of NF1 is associated with sustained activation of Ras proteins, leading to hyperactivation of MAPK and PI3K-AKT intracellular signaling pathway that evokes melanogenesis. Similar to CM, NF1 suppression is significantly enriched in tumors lacking either BRAF or NRAS mutations (16, 96). However, in melanomas harboring both BRAF and NF1 mutations, it is more likely that tumors can escape from MAPK inhibiting therapy (97, 98). Meanwhile, NF1 is significantly co-mutated with KIT in 32% of MMs, whereas the co-occurrence level in CM is merely 4% (99), which indicates that the MAPK cascade is upregulated in MM not only by the single protein in the cytoplasm but also by the assistance of C-KIT receptor on the cell membrane.SPRED1 is another potential driver gene for MM. SPRED1, sprout-related, EVH1 domain containing protein 1, is a tumor suppressor. SPRED1 facilitates the localization of NF1 to the plasma membrane where it suppresses RAS signaling (6). Therefore, the loss of SPRED1 function leads to the activation of MAPK pathway signaling transduction. 7.5% of MM have SPRED1 inactivating mutations and 12% undergo SPRED1 copy number loss (16), whereas SPRED1 alterations are insignificant in CM (17, 79). In MM, SPRED1 loss rarely co-occurs with BRAF mutations, NRAS mutations, or NF1 inactivation mutations (6), indicating those alterations play similar roles in activating MAPK pathway signaling in MM. Analogous to NF1, around 30% of MM cases with SPRED1 inactivation simultaneously exhibit KIT alterations, suggesting that SPRED1 inactivation may be in collaboration with other oncogenic events to stimulate tumor development (100). Based on the pattern of mutually exclusive occurrence of NF1 and SPRED1 and their respective tendency to alter simultaneously with KIT, it is reasonable to speculate that NF1 and SPRED1 loss function similarly in MM. In addition, it has been proposed that the reduced sensitivity and drug resistance to KIT inhibitors partially result from the hyperactivation of MAPK caused by the loss of SPRED1 ‚Äì a model verified in human melanoma cell lines and in vivo zebrafish model (6, 101), but presently untested in mouse models and patient samples.PI3K-AKT-mTOR PathwayThe PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is another frequently activated oncogenic signaling cascade in MM, which is verified by elevated AKT phosphorylation through immunohistochemical staining (102, 103). The aforementioned abnormal KIT, NRAS, NF1, and SPRED1 genes are able to not only activate the MAPK signaling cascade but also dysregulate the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Additionally, the PI3K pathway is stimulated by suppression of a negative regulator, phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) (104). Compared with 12% of PTEN loss in CM where deletions and mutations both account for the changes (17, 79), PTEN is deeply deleted in merely 6.0% of MM cases and has hardly any mutations (16) Furthermore, there is rare co-occurrence of deleted PTEN and amplified KIT that possibly implies that loss of PTEN or gain of KIT are redundant for the activation of the PI3K pathway in MM. This is also supported by the fact that besides KIT and PTEN, mutations in PI3K and AKT homologous of PI3K-AKT-mTOR are scarce (4.8% PIK3CA, 3.8% PIK3CG, and 4.8% AKT3) (105). It has been reported that silencing of PTEN cooperates with activated AKT to promote metastasis of melanoma (102, 103, 106, 107), but MM does not show a weaker performance in metastasis than CM in the clinic possibly because there are other gene alterations in the PI3K pathway promoting invasiveness of tumor (108). In a cohort of 91 MM patients, 18% of cases show TSC1 loss-of-function mutations which plays a suppressive role in cellular proliferation initiated by mTOR (109) and a similar result also showed in a recently published meta-analysis review of MM (105). Due to the limited sample size, the alteration levels for TSC need to be further verified. Taking into account the frequency of alterations in known genes involved in PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway activation, applying PI3K pathway blockers could possibly be an effective target strategy in MM patients.The Spliceosome PathwayThe spliceosome complex is responsible for the removal of introns from precursor mRNA and the ligation of exons to form mature mRNA. SF3B1 (splicing factor 3b subunit 1) is the largest and core component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) and thus SF3B1 mutations directly cause aberrant gene transcripts which eventually lead to mRNA degradation or abnormal protein function or protein decay (110, 111). SF3B1 mutations have been reported in 12% of MM (16), while a very small portion of tested CM patients harbor similar alterations (17, 79, 112). Despite their notable absence in CM, alterations in the SF3B1 gene are not unique to MM - similar mutations have also been detected in uveal melanoma, breast cancer, myelodysplastic syndromes, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including mutation hotspots such as codon 700, 622, 625, 662, and 666 (99, 113). To be more specific, SF3B1 mutations at codon 625 are predominately associated with mucosal and uveal melanoma, while alterations at codon 700 are present across myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (6), implying disparate SF3B1 mutational preference that is possibly related to distinct etiology. Although SF3B1 mutations are widely present in MM, it is poorly understood which genes alternatively spliced by mutant SF3B1 drive malignant transformation. It has been discovered that BRD9, PPP2R5A, and DVL2, are candidate genes for alternative splicing in SF3B1 K700-mutant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (114‚Äì116), while ABCC5, UQCC, and CRNDE are possible targets in three uveal melanoma cases mixed with R625 and K700 mutations (117). Hence, due to the variability of SF3B1 mutations in solid and hematologic cancers, experiments that query the consequence of the SF3B1 R625 mutation in mucosal melanocytes are needed to understand mis-spliced targets and tumorigenic oncogenic mechanisms related to SF3B1 mutations in MM.Intriguingly, although SF3B1 does not possess a direct role in MAPK pathway signal transduction, there is little overlap between tumors with MAPK pathway mutations and SF3B1-mutated tumors, suggesting that SF3B1 mutations possibly lead to splicing variations of specific genes that can lead to MAPK activation (16). Meanwhile, the MAPK pathway can also regulate splicesome activity. It is reported that activation of the MEK-ERK pathway by Golgi stress enhances the activity of ETS transcriptional factors that have the capacity to regulate the expression of splicesome components, resulting in a switch of MCL1 protein function through different splicing (118). This study indicates that dysregulation of some downstream effectors by the MAPK pathway is able to lead to splicing aberrations. The mechanisms connecting the splicing alternations to signal transduction remain enigmatic. Mutant K700E SF3B1 causes loss of function of phosphatase PP2A, followed by the phosphorylation changes related to signaling cascade (115), thereby providing a potential link between an alternative splicing and signaling pathways. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the specific mis-spliced genes and proteins directly influenced by SF3B1 mutations together with the crosstalk between SF3B1 and MAPK pathway in tumorigenesis of MM, and the findings may provide a new perspective for targeted therapy.Cell Cycle PathwayThe abrogation of cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis regulators is widely present in melanoma (119), including CDKN2A loss and CDK4/6 or CCND1 amplification. The CDKN2A locus encodes two distinct tumor suppressors, p16INK4A and p14ARF. The p16INK4A protein suppresses the forward progression of the cell cycle by inhibiting CDK4 or CDK6. The CDK4/6/CCND1 complex phosphorylates and inhibits the retinoblastoma (Rb), which leads to E2F1 transcription activation and G1-S phase cell cycle transmission (120). The other CDKN2A transcript, p14ARF, functions, at least in part, by blocking MDM2 ubiquitylation mediated TP53 degradation, which permits apoptosis escape (121). In MM patients, 24% of tumors exhibit copy number loss of CDKN2A (16). Additionally, CDK4, CCND1, and MDM2 are amplified in 28%, 18%, and 19% of samples respectively, and TP53 mutations occur in 9.0% of MMs (16). Most of these cell cycle components are also commonly disrupted in CM. However, although CM has a much higher CDKN2A loss than MM, MM tends to show a greater frequency of CCND1 and CDK4 amplification (120, 122), implying CDK4 blocking agents may achieve a desired anti-tumor effect on MM. Intriguingly, MM cells without mutations in BRAF or NRAS mutations tend to exhibit CCND1 or CDK4 amplification (122), suggesting that copy number variations of cell cycle regulatory genes act as an alternative driver and can substitute for BRAF or NRAS mediated proliferation signaling pathway activation.Telomere MaintenanceTelomerase reverse transcriptase, encoded by the gene TERT, is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme telomerase, responsible for lengthening telomeres at the end of chromatin (123, 124). Thus, overexpression of TERT confers the potential of cells to become immortal (125), which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. TERT promoter mutations and TERT amplifications are common genetic events in the early stages of melanoma of the skin (8). For CM, more than two-thirds of tumors exhibit TERT promoter mutation, and only a minority of malignancies present copy number amplification (17, 79). As a comparison, the frequency of TERT activating alteration in MM declines to 30%, and most of them are copy number gain rather than promoter mutations (16). As for why CM and MM present distinct mechanisms of TERT activation, most TERT promoter mutations in CM are C>T mutations or CC>TT di-pyrimidine mutations (126, 127), suggesting that TERT promoter mutations are induced by UV radiation which partially explains why these mutations are rare in sun-shielded MM. Apart from TERT, the gene ATRX is also involved in telomere maintenance. ATRX is associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres as an additional mechanism for telomere maintenance in tumors lacking TERT promoter mutations (128). Despite rare samples associated with ATRX alterations in CM, nonsense mutation and frameshift of ATRX are detected in 11.9% of MMs (16) implying that ATRX is responsible for telomere extension in MM as well. However, the altering level of ATRX needs to be further tested in a larger cohort since the gene are not significantly mutated in other sequencing results except for Newell‚Äôs study.Although CM exhibits a much higher frequency of TERT activation than MM, there is no statistically significant difference in telomere length among CM and MM, and both of them even undergo telomere shortening (8, 79, 129). Those intriguing findings remind us that aberrant TERT might have tumorigenic impacts in melanocytes other than telomere lengthening. It is reported that human TERT (hTERT) is equipped with a telomere protective function independent of its canonical catalytic activity (130). Overexpression of hTERT in melanoma is able to produce a protective complex on DNA damage that leads to the sustained proliferation capacity of cancer cells (130). In addition, phosphorylated TERT at a specific position by CDK1 has an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity (131). RdRP generates small interfering RNAs complementary to a tumor suppressor gene FOXO4, degrading mRNAs of FOXO4, reducing protein expression and consequently leading to tumor formation (131, 132). Taken together, these observations suggest potential differences in telomere maintenance mechanisms among different subtypes of melanoma.Progress in MM Target TherapyWhen compared with CM, MM is typically detected at advanced stages, which renders the tumor challenging to treat. Surgical excision is predominately the first choice for MM (133‚Äì135). However, due to the lentiginous growth pattern, multifocal nature of MM, and limitations of the specific MM anatomic sites, it is extremely difficult for surgery to achieve wide negative margins, which leads to a high local relapse rate at 50%-90% (2). For unresectable and metastatic MM, targeted therapy and immunotherapy are constrained since MM is deficient in dominant MAPK activating mutations that can be targeted and is less responsive to immunotherapy (136). Therefore, to date, the first-line therapeutic modality for advanced MM remains chemotherapy despite limited efficacy (137).While targeted therapies for MM are limited, multiple clinical trials targeting aberrant genes in MM are ongoing. Similar to CM, the MAPK cascade is hyperactivated by altered genes in MM including NRAS, BRAF, NF1, and SPRED1, thereby making inhibition of MAPK signal transduction a promising treatment strategy for MM patients. For the minority of MM patients with BRAF mutations, combined inhibition of BRAF and MEK is an attractive strategy because the combination therapy shows an impressive response rate at 76% and has a 5-year survival rate of 33% for BRAFV600E/K positive CM patients (138). Although there is no clinical trial underway specifically evaluating the safety and efficacy of combination therapy of BRAF inhibitor plus MEK inhibitor in MM, a retrospective study in Japan showed that MM/AM and CM exhibited similar response rates to combined BRAF and MEK suppression (64.3% vs 76.5%) (139), suggesting the potential efficiency of dual repression of BRAF and MEK in MM. For patients without BRAF mutations but with NRAS, NF1, or SPRED1 alterations, targeting the downstream protein MEK is another strategy for MM patients. The safety and efficacy of MEK blocking agents in MM have been confirmed in an ongoing phase 2 study where 20% NRAS-mutated melanoma patients showed partial response to MEK inhibitor binimetinib with tolerated and manageable adverse events (140). However, for both monotherapy of MEK inhibitor and combined treatment of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, acquired resistance through reactivation of the MAPK pathway can restrict their therapeutic efficacy (141). To overcome this resistance, it is necessary to inhibit downstream proteins like ERK or develop new molecules targeting aberrant MAPK signaling. Meanwhile, besides independent suppression of MAPK pathway, MEK blockers have also been combined with mTOR1/2, AKT, or CDK4/6 inhibitors in preclinical models or in clinical trials of MM (142‚Äì144). Although therapeutic parameters do not significantly improve compared to the single MAPK inhibition, dual signaling pathway blocking still provides a new perspective for MM targeted therapy.Interestingly, compared to CM, MM patients tend to harbor more activating mutations or amplifications in the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, providing a rationale for targeting C-KIT. Imatinib, sunitinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and masitinib are approved C-KIT inhibitors in different cancer types and their anti-cancer effects for MM are currently in the clinical research stage (145‚Äì148). Imatinib is the most widely investigated C-KIT inhibitor. In a recent trial of 78 melanoma patients harboring KIT alterations, the median overall survival for imatinib is 13.1 months and the objective response rate is 21.8% (149). Additionally, it has been discovered that C-KIT inhibitor imatinib harbors high efficacy against melanoma with KIT mutations, but not with KIT amplification only (54% vs 0% partial response) (148, 150). To be more specific, MMs with KIT mutations in exon 11 (L576P) and exon 13 (K642E) tend to have a better and longer response to C-KIT inhibitors than other mutations (84, 151). Despite the strong anti-tumor effect of C-KIT inhibitors, MM patients who respond to the inhibiting agents well at the beginning will frequently experience a brief period of disease response before developing resistance to KIT inhibitors that eventually leads to progressive disease (152, 153). The acquired resistance to KIT inhibitors is possibly conferred from pre-existing concomitant mutations in other oncogenes like NRAS or secondary KIT mutations during the use of drugs. For instance, secondary A829P KIT mutation renders melanoma cells resistant to imatinib but has no influence on nilotinib and dasatinib, while the T670I KIT mutation exhibits resistance to imatinib, nilotinib as well as dasatinib, but can still be suppressed by sunitinib (154). Considering the promising performance of C-KIT inhibitors in MM, now more efforts have been focused on the understanding of the acquired resistance mechanism and the development of new blocking agents to overcome resistance, offering hope for patients with advanced MM and limited treatment options.In the future, targeted therapy could offer an alternative adjuvant therapy option for a group of patients based on their gene sequencing results. If actionable driver mutations are identified in an individual MM, targeted therapies for the driver genes or proteins could be utilized on a patient-by-patient basis. Until now there are only a few available targeted therapies for MM clinical trials: BRAF, MEK, CDK4/6 and, C-KIT inhibitors, with limited clinical use and efficacy. Therefore, it requires more efforts on developing other alternative targeting strategies based on mutated genes in MM such as splicesome complex components, telomerase, and DNA repair pathway. H3B-8800, for instance, is the blocker for splicing modulator of SF3B complex and it at present is in phase I study of myeloid cancers (155). Considering the MM specific SF3B1 hotspot mutation in R625, developing strategies that can specifically target R625 mutant SF3B1 might may achieve benefit MM patients with low side effects.DiscussionMM is a rare but aggressive malignancy. Due at least in part to delayed diagnosis at the advanced stage and the lack of efficient therapeutic strategies, this subtype of melanoma is associated with a worse prognosis than melanoma arising from the skin. In contrast to CM, the etiology, risk factors, and pathogenesis of MM are poorly understood, partially explaining the deficiency of effective treatment options and extremely poor prognosis. This review takes OMM as a model and attempts to identify commonalities in etiology, pathogenesis, mutation patterns, and corresponding pathway dependency. Besides cigarette smoking, denture irritation, and alcohol, chronic infections caused by microorganisms and mechanical stress generated by routine activities may have an impact on tumorigenesis in the mucosal membrane. However, the oral microflora is in a dynamic process of change and is influenced by many internal and external factors, including the host‚Äôs physical conditions, diet, and hygiene habits. A more comprehensive study investigating the relationship between flora and cancer, the selection of patients, sampling locations, and control settings will be needed.Since there is limited knowledge about pre-MM lesions and a lack of corresponding molecular pathological biomarkers, early diagnosis, as well as early intervention becomes extremely challenging, leading to the short life expectancy in MM patients. Due to the unclear relationships between benign lesions and precursor lesions, histopathological information alone cannot thoroughly define and accurately discriminate them. It is reported that one patient died of OMM after 63 months of misdiagnosed premalignant atypical melanocytic hyperplasia as a benign lentigo simplex (50). Therefore, it is an urgent need to discover biomarkers for lesions with a greater tendency of malignant transformation. To achieve this goal, a thorough genomic and transcriptomic profiling of the evolutionary trajectories of MM starting from benign lesions and potential intermediate lesions is worth pursuit. Another strategy for studying cancer evolution is to establish transgenic mice that capture the evolution process of MM. However, unlike CM, there is a lack of animal models that can recapitulate the oncogenesis process accompanied with the accumulation of genetic alterations in MM. By stepwise introduction of BRAF V600E mutation, CDKN2A loss, PTEN loss and mTOR activation, CM precursor lesions followed by CM formation was observed in mice (156‚Äì159). Likewise, decoding the accumulative mutation pattern based on MM patient samples will pave the path to the generation of MM transgenic mice model, which not only contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of MM but also serve as functional tools to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutic modalities.Recent sequencing studies have identified significant alterations in NRAS, BRAF, NF1, KIT, SF3B1, TP53, and SPRED1, informing potential targeted therapeutic strategies for MM (14‚Äì16, 160, 161). Firstly, MM patients have shown similar pathway dependency although with divergent mutation patterns. Compared to CM, fewer NRAS, BRAF mutations are seen in MM, but more SF3B1 mutation and KIT alterations are found. Since targetable BRAF mutations are far less frequent in MM, target validation of other alterations in the MAPK pathway is needed. The sequencing results of 67 MMs show that mutations of NRAS, BRAF, KIT, and SF3B1 are mutually exclusive, implying those mutations may converge on activating the MAPK pathways (16). Further studies about how SF3B1 mutations are involved in MAPK pathway activation are needed. Secondly, MM has gained fewer genetic mutations for cell cycle regulators but more copy number changes than CM. While CDKN2A copy number loss is a frequently observed event in both CM and MM, MM presents more CDK4 and CCND1 amplifications, which makes targeting CDK4 promising in MM.It is worth mentioning that MM has a much higher level of structure variation and chromosomal instability compared to CM. As a result, specific attention should be paid to targeting the chromosomal rearrangements. Targeting genes involved in DNA damage repair response including PARP, DNA-PKcs, ATR, ATM, CHK1, WEE1 might achieve unexpected clinical response in MM patients (162‚Äì164). Olaparib, for instance, is an FDA-approved inhibitor of the enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) which can efficiently kill BRCA mutant tumor cells, a successful synthetic lethality based targeting strategy used in breast cancers and ovarian cancers (165). Although MM rarely shows BRCA mutations, the significantly high level of structure variation indicates the deficiency of homologous recombination repair (HRR) capacity, which makes MM potentially responsive to PARP inhibition. Nevertheless, a more comprehensive understanding about the mutation signatures as well as signatures of chromosome structure variation in MM are needed. A more stringent validation of PARP inhibitor response in MM cell lines, PDX, and early clinical trials are supposed to conduct to better understand the pharmacological mechanism of drug response in MM.Other than targeted therapy, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) based immunotherapy has shown a strong anti-tumor effect on metastatic CM. Ipilimumab against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), nivolumab and pembrolizumab against programmed death 1 (PD1) as well as atezolizumab against programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) are approved by the FDA for the treatment for advanced melanoma either as monotherapy or combination therapy (166). The overall response rate (ORR) for CM patients to ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab is 12%, 40%, 33% and 30% respectively (167‚Äì169), while the combined treatment of ipilimumab with nivolumab significantly improves the ORR to 61% with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 11.5 months (170, 171). However, those ICBs do not exert a satisfactorily inhibitory impact on MM as they do on CM, showing the ORR to anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1/PDL1 as the single agent from 7% to 35% (136, 172‚Äì174). Even the combination regimen of anti-CTLA4 (ipilimumab) and anti-PD1 (nivolumab) agents merely witness a slight increased ORR to 37% with PFS at 5.9 month (136, 175). The limited response to ICBs in MM is mainly because of low mutation burden and limited immune cell infiltration compared to CM (3, 176, 177). To further overcome unsatisfactory performance of ICBs in MM, combination of ICBs with different targeted therapy strategies has been tested in clinical trials. For example, a phase Ib trial using PD-1 antibody toripalimab and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) inhibitor axitinib showed a dramatical improvement in ORR and PFS to 61% and 9.1 months separately (178, 179), although the safety and efficacy of this combination strategy needs to be further validated. Meanwhile, the combination of toripalimab and vorolanib which targets and inhibits multi-tyrosine kinase including VEGF and C-KIT are ongoing in MM trial (180).In summary, both basic research and drug discoveries in CM have achieved enormous progress, whereas little is known about either how MM initiates or how to target MM. As a result, patients of MM are suffering from limited treatment options and undesirable response rates that lead to extremely poor prognoses. Here we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding initiation and progression of MM and the risk factors and treatment options for MM. In doing so, we highlight current gaps in our knowledge regarding MM progression, and propose important future research directions, includes studying the genetic evolution trajectory of MM from benign precursor lesions and evaluating new targeting strategies specifically for MM, such as targeting CDK4, SF3B1 or PARP, either as single agent or in combinations with ICBs. We hope these efforts will give more comprehensive knowledge about how MM initiates and progresses, provide more specific biomarkers for MM early diagnosis, offer more potentially effective treatment options for MM and, in the end, improve the life expectancy and quality for MM patients.Author ContributionsYM wrote the main body of the paper.

        Abstract



Mucosal melanomas are a rare subtype of melanoma, arising in mucosal tissues, which have a very poor prognosis due to the lack of effective targeted therapies. This study aimed to better understand the molecular landscape of these cancers and find potential new therapeutic targets. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on mucosal melanomas from 19 patients and 135 sun-exposed cutaneous melanomas, with matched peripheral blood samples when available. Mutational profiles were compared between mucosal subgroups and sun-exposed cutaneous melanomas. Comparisons of molecular profiles identified 161 genes enriched in mucosal melanoma (P<0.05). KIT and NF1 were frequently comutated (32%) in the mucosal subgroup, with a significantly higher incidence than that in cutaneous melanoma (4%). Recurrent SF3B1 R625H/S/C mutations were identified and validated in 7 of 19 (37%) mucosal melanoma patients. Mutations in the spliceosome pathway were found to be enriched in mucosal melanomas when compared with cutaneous melanomas. Alternative splicing in four genes were observed in SF3B1-mutant samples compared with the wild-type samples. This study identified potential new therapeutic targets for mucosal melanoma, including comutation of NF1 and KIT, and recurrent R625 mutations in SF3B1. This is the first report of SF3B1 R625 mutations in vulvovaginal mucosal melanoma, with the largest whole-exome sequencing project of mucosal melanomas to date. The results here also indicated that the mutations in SF3B1 lead to alternative splicing in multiple genes. These findings expand our knowledge of this rare disease.


Introduction
Melanomas in mucosal tissue are uncommon and account for only 1% or less of all melanomas. They are not related to sun exposure or other known environmental factors and are not familial. Mucosal melanomas have been shown to have distinct molecular profiles compared with cutaneous melanoma arising on sun-exposed sites 1,2. Unfortunately, many of the advances made in the understanding and treatment of cutaneous melanoma in the past 5 years are not readily applicable to mucosal melanomas 3,4. Common molecular drivers identified in cutaneous melanoma, such as mutated BRAF V600E, have not been identified in mucosal melanoma. Oncogenic drivers of mucosal melanoma remain unclear as there have been no consistent molecular targets described 5. In addition, the current immunotherapies targeting CTLA4 and PD1 for cutaneous melanomas have had little success in mucosal melanomas 3.
In order to better understand the mutational profile of mucosal melanoma, several investigators have performed next-generation sequencing on a small number of mucosal melanomas and compared them with cutaneous melanoma. Furney et al.1 examined the mutational spectra of 10 mucosal melanomas from the head and neck, rectum, penis, and vagina. These studies have provided the foundation for understanding the molecular profiles of mucosal melanoma. Our study expands this knowledge by contributing the largest whole-exome sequenced cohort of mucosal melanoma known to date with validated mutations and differentially spliced genes as a result of these mutations.
In the present study, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on tissue samples from 19 patients with mucosal melanomas from various sites. The samples were from five anorectal melanomas, five nasopharyngeal melanomas, and nine vulvovaginal melanomas. We compared and contrasted mutational profiles from these with 135 cutaneous melanomas from sun-exposed sites from our in-house melanoma tissue bank [International Melanoma Biorepository and Research Laboratory (IMBRL)]. We identified comutations in NF1 and KIT in 32% of our patient samples. Discovery of these comutations could provide insight into the lack of response of mucosal melanoma to traditional melanoma treatments. Importantly, we discovered a recurrent R625 mutation in SF3B1, in vulvovaginal melanomas that was previously only described in anorectal and ocular melanomas 6,7. We confirmed that SF3B1-mutant samples have differential splicing of at least four genes found in previously described SF3B1-mutant cancers 6,8. This study provides important new clues into the molecular changes that occur in mucosal melanomas. These findings may lead to a better understanding of the development, molecular drivers, and hence improved therapeutics for these rare forms of melanoma.
Methods
Clinical review
The IMBRL at the University of Colorado Cancer Center currently contains over 3900 melanoma patient tissue and peripheral blood samples. Nineteen mucosal melanoma patients had formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded, and/or fresh frozen tissues meeting quality standards for mutational analysis by means of WES and had (when available) normal peripheral blood DNA in our biorepository. More than one tissue sample was available for some patients. WES was performed on 40 tissue samples from 19 patients.
Sample collection and genomic DNA isolation
Tissue and peripheral blood samples were collected between 2008 and 2016 from melanoma patients and stored in the IMBRL at the University of Colorado Cancer Center. All collections were made in accordance with review board approval and with the patient‚Äôs written consent (COMIRB-05-0309). Many of these patients had multiple tissue or peripheral blood samples collected at different times, and all samples from which adequate DNA could be extracted were submitted for WES. Blood samples were collected in PAXGene (Qiagen & BD, Feldbachstrasse, Switzerland) DNA tubes and stored at 4¬∞C until processed. Depending on material, tissue genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA) or the QiaAmp DNA formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded kit (Qiagen). The concentration of DNA was determined using a UV spectrophotometer and stored at 4¬∞C.
Next-generation whole-exome sequencing
DNA concentration and purity were determined using Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA) analysis. Genomic DNA (200‚Äâng) was sheared using Covaris (Woburn, Massachusetts, USA) S220 at 150‚Äâbp. Sheared DNA was used to construct the exome library following Agilent SureSelect XT Target Enrichment System (Agilent Technologies) for Illumina Paired End Multiplexed Sequencing Library (catalog #G9641B; Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). Sheared DNA was end repaired, followed by addition of adapter tags to construct DNA libraries through PCR amplification. Exome capture was performed through hybridization using XT5 probe. Resulting captured libraries were indexed and purified. The cDNA library was validated on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using DNA-1000 chip. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 with 125‚Äâbp paired-end reads. We obtained an average of 400√ó and 200√ó sequencing coverage for the cancer and normal exomes, respectively.
Whole-exome sequencing pipeline and bioinformatics analysis
In order to establish the mutational profiles in mucosal melanomas, we used WES to analyze tissue and matched peripheral blood (when available) from 19 patients with mucosal melanomas. For comparison, we used WES data from 135 primary and metastatic cutaneous sun-exposed melanoma samples from our biorepository.
All samples from both cutaneous and mucosal patients were analyzed for variants and copy number alterations using IMPACT, our recently published WES analysis pipeline 9. In brief, IMPACT is a discovery-oriented WES analysis pipeline designed to detect variant reads found in at least 10% of sequencing reads (minimum of four variant reads out of 20 mapped reads). To eliminate potential false positives, IMPACT performs a stringent filtering step, keeping only nonsynonymous somatic variants that are predicted to be deleterious by SIFT 10 and PolyPhen2 11 or were present in the COSMIC database 12. By doing this, IMPACT is able to detect more subclonal variants but only keeps those variants that are predicted to be the most deleterious. To remove germline variants, a normal blood DNA sample from the same patient was used as control. Somatic variants found in each patient are listed in Supplementary Table 1 (http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/Mucosal_Melanoma/MucosalData/).
Somatic variants in genes were compared between mucosal and cutaneous groups. A Fisher‚Äôs exact test was performed for each gene found in at least 30% of the mucosal samples. False discovery rate was applied to the gene list. Genes with P value less than 0.05 and false discovery rate less than 20% were considered as mutated genes enriched in the mucosal samples. The BAM files from our mucosal cohort can be downloaded at http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/Mucosal_Melanoma/MucosalData/. We queried the mutated genes with the KEGG pathway database to identify enriched pathways in the mucosal samples 13. For mucosal samples in which we had more than one sample, we combined all samples into one profile for each patient. A total of 161 genes were found to be enriched in mucosal melanoma (Supplementary Table 2, http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/Mucosal_Melanoma/MucosalData/).
Direct Sanger sequencing of SF3B1 R625 variants
Exon 14 of the SF3B1 gene was amplified from ‚àº100 to 300‚Äâng of genomic DNA. Previously reported forward and reverse primers were used 14. PCR was carried out using GoTaq Master Mix (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) with a final primer concentration of 0.4‚Äâmmol/l and a final reaction volume of 50‚ÄâŒºl. Thermocycling was carried out on the GeneAmp PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, California, USA). PCR products were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel. PCR products were purified using the ExoSap IT enzyme mix (USB Corporation, Santa Clara, California, USA). Approximately 15‚Äâng/ml of the PCR product was sent for direct sequence analysis at the Barbara Davis Center Molecular Biology Core Facility.
Splice variant analysis using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
Previously reported forward and reverse primers were retrieved from Furney et al.6 and Maguire et al. 8 for predicted splice variants in SF3B1-mutant and wild-type samples (Supplementary Table 2, http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/Mucosal_Melanoma/MucosalData/). cDNA (10‚Äâng) was analyzed in triplicate to quantify spliced and unspliced forms using real-time quantitative PCR, and repeated three times for an n=3. Briefly, 45 cycles of quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) were conducted in 96-well plates using PowerUp SYBR Green reagents (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) on the StepOnePlus instrument (Applied Biosystems). To perform splice variant analysis for each gene of interest was calculated by averaging the Ct values per sample, and calculating the ratio of spliced form using the formula . For each splicing event, a two-tailed unpaired t-test (using GraphPad Prism software; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, California, USA) was applied between SF3B1 mutated (n=3) and wild-type (n=4) cases. Differences were considered significant at P value less than 0.05.
Patient-derived tumor xenograft and cell line models
The human mucosal melanoma explant xenografts were generated according to previously published methods 15,16. Female athymic nude (nu/nu) mice were purchased form Harlan Labs at age 4‚Äì6 weeks. Briefly, surgical specimens from consented patients undergoing removal of primary or metastatic tumor at the University of Colorado Hospital were reimplanted subcutaneously into five mice for each patient. Tumors were allowed to grow to a size of 1000‚Äì1500‚Äâmm3 (F1), at which point they were harvested, divided, and transplanted to another five mice (F2) to maintain the tumor bank. Tumor samples were collected from F1 and F2 for RNA isolation. Animal studies were performed in a facility accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care in accordance with the NIH guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee before initiation. Cell lines Mel202 (ECACC) and MP41 (ATCC) were maintained according to manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. The SF3B1 status was verified by means of Sanger sequencing using the methods and primers (Supplementary Table 3, http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/Mucosal_Melanoma/MucosalData/) described above.
Results
Mucosal melanoma patient information
To define the mutational landscape of mucosal melanoma patients, we performed WES on 19 patients with paired tumor and normal samples. On average, we obtained 400√ó and 200√ó coverage for the cancer and normal exomes (when available), respectively. The clinical details of the patients included in this study are shown in Table 1. There were five patients each with anorectal and nasopharyngeal melanoma and nine patients with vulvovaginal melanomas. The median age was 64 years across all subtypes. The tissue source includes a combination of both primary and metastatic lesions (Fig. 1 and Table 1).Table 1: Cumulative clinical data and mutational status for 19 patients with mucosal melanomaFig. 1: Mutational landscape of 19 mucosal melanomas compared with cutaneous melanomas. Important differences in individual genes are shown along with P values. Note in particular the significantly higher frequency of mutations in KIT, NF1, and SF3B1 in mucosal melanomas. Common melanoma genes occur in low frequency as highlighted within the figure. Tissue source and mutational signature for individual samples are presented in the lower panel.Mutated genes enriched in mucosal melanomas
Overall, 161 genes were found to be enriched in the mucosal patient samples (Supplementary Table 2, http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/Mucosal_Melanoma/MucosalData/) when compared with our cutaneous melanoma cohort. KM2TC was the most frequently mutated gene (52%) in the cohort, followed by KIT, DIAPH1, and LAMA3 (50%). NF1 was found mutated in seven patient samples; six of these patient samples (32% of all samples) also had a co-occurring KIT mutation. Figure 1 summarizes the genes significantly enriched for mutations in mucosal versus cutaneous melanomas.
We identified SF3B1, with a recurrent somatic mutation at codon R625 in 37% (7/19) of the mucosal melanomas. Notably, the recurrent SF3B1 mutation was only found to be mutated in anorectal and vulvovaginal patients but not in nasopharyngeal melanoma samples. There was one nasopharyngeal patient with a previously undescribed SF3B1 E1105G mutation. Table 1 describes the specific mutations found in each patient sample.
In contrast, oncogenic driver mutations in BRAF were not detected in mucosal melanomas, and the mutations found were not commonly identified in cutaneous melanoma (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Other commonly mutated genes (e.g. NRAS, GNA11, GNAS) in cutaneous and/or uveal melanoma are not enriched in mucosal melanomas (Fig. 1). Figure 2 molecularly classifies the patient samples with the common mutations of BRAF (V600), NRAS (G12, G13, Q61), NF1, and KIT mutations in our mucosal and cutaneous cohorts, as well as those samples that lacked these gene mutations (pan negative). The most striking observation is the significantly higher occurrence of comutation of KIT and NF1 in mucosal melanoma (32%), compared with cutaneous melanoma (1%) (Fig. 2b). This occurrence was observed in 22% in the vulvovaginal, 20% in the nasopharyngeal, and 60% in the anorectal subtype (Fig. 2b). We found that the nasopharyngeal mucosal melanomas are highly enriched (80%) in the pan-negative cluster (Fig. 2b). This supports the hypothesis that mucosal melanomas have a different mutational landscape compared with the cutaneous melanomas.Fig. 2: Molecular classification of melanoma with BRAF (V600), NRAS (G12, G13, Q61), NF1, and KIT mutations. (a) Comparison of all 19 mucosal melanomas with our 135 cutaneous melanomas. (b) The difference in molecular classifications between mucosal melanomas arising in different anatomic sites.Pathways enriched in mucosal melanomas versus cutaneous melanomas
We next investigated these enriched genes mutated in mucosal melanomas by querying KEGG pathway database. We found that these enriched genes in mucosal melanomas were involved in focal adhesion, cell adhesion, the RAS, MAPK, and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, as well as the spliceosome pathway (Fig. 3a). SF3B1 was the most enriched gene in the mucosal cohort, and the pathway analysis led to the identification of another spliceosome gene, EFTUD2. We expanded our investigation to include gene members described in the KEGG spliceosome pathway and published papers 8. We found that 68% of mucosal melanoma patients had one or more of the spliceosome genes mutated (Fig. 3b). The number of genes enriched in this pathway in the mucosal patient samples was significant when compared with the cutaneous cohort (P=0.0097). The occurrence of these mutations within the spliceosome pathway is depicted in Fig. 3c.Fig. 3: (a) Pathway analysis of genes enriched in mucosal melanoma. (b) Spliceosome pathway genes found in mucosal melanoma were enriched when compared with cutaneous melanomas. (c) Pathway visualization of the spliceosome pathway with mutated genes shown in red.Recurrent mutation in SF3B1 in anorectal and vulvovaginal melanomas
From the WES analysis, we identified a total of seven vulvovaginal and anorectal mucosal melanomas harboring the SF3B1 recurrent mutations (R625H/S/C) and one nasopharyngeal mucosal melanoma mutated at E1105G. Within anorectal and vulvovaginal melanomas, SF3B1 R625 mutations occurred in 50% (7/14) of all samples. The recurrent mutation at codon R625 in SF3B1 is similar to the previously reported mutation in uveal melanoma 17. To validate this recurrent R625 mutation in mucosal melanoma identified by means of WES, we performed direct Sanger sequencing on exon 14 of SF3B1 in all of our SF3B1-mutant mucosal patient samples, and a subset of SF3B1 wild-type samples. The Sanger sequencing results validated the WES findings of SF3B1 R625 mutations in these samples (Supplementary Fig. 1, http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/Mucosal_Melanoma/MucosalData/).
SF3B1 is a component of the spliceosome and plays a key role in early stages of pre-mRNA splicing (Fig. 3c). Mutations in SF3B1 are rare in cutaneous melanomas 14, and none of our in-house 135 cutaneous melanomas had an SF3B1 mutation. This suggests that SF3B1 might be exploited as a novel prognostic and/or therapeutic target, specifically in mucosal melanomas for anorectal and vulvovaginal sites. Figure 4a illustrates the known SF3B1 mutations found in this study and other published cancer studies from cBioPortal 7,18. Both uveal melanoma and breast cancer harbor mutations in the HEAT domain of SF3B1, with a majority of samples having mutations at positions R625 and K700, respectively (Fig. 4a) 6,8,17. Mutations in the HEAT (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, Targets of rapamycin 1) domain of SF3B1, such as R625 and K700, have been associated with alternative splicing events, primarily through the induction of aberrant 3‚Ä≤ splice site selection 6,8,19.Fig. 4: (a) Number and location of SF3B1 mutations found in the literature and cBioPortal, followed by the proportion of each cancer‚Äôs subtype. Highlighted in pink is the current study representing the largest percentage SF3B1 mutations of any cohort to date.

(b) CRNDE, (c) RPL31, (d) ABCC5, and (e) TMEM14C were validated using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR in three SF3B1 wild-type (blue) and two SF3B1 R625 (red) mucosal melanoma PDX samples. Uveal melanoma cell lines were used as controls, MP41 (SF3B1 wild-type) and Mel202 (SF3B1 R625G). Unpaired two-tail parametric t-tests were used to determine significance between mutant and wild-type. *P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Schematic representations of the splicing events is illustrated above each graph. Exons are represented as boxes, with lines representing splicing events occurring in SF3B1 wild-type (blue) and SF3B1 mutant (red). ***P value of less than 0.01.Functional validation of differential splicing genes in SF3B1-mutant mucosal melanomas
Recent functional studies in uveal melanoma, breast cancer, and hematological malignancies have identified genes that are differentially spliced in SF3B1-mutant tumors compared with wild type 6,8,20. Considering the functional role of mutant SF3B1 in inducing differential splicing, we hypothesized that SF3B1 R625H/S/C mutations in mucosal melanoma would also lead to differential splicing of genes as compared with SF3B1 wild-type tumors.
To test this hypothesis, we performed qRT-PCR using specific primer design to target alternatively spliced genes previously found in SF3B1-mutant samples. We selected seven genes (ABCC5, ANKHD1, CRNDE, GUSPB11, RPL31, TMEM14C, and UQCC) that have been previously identified by means of RNA sequencing and validated using qRT-PCR to be differentially spliced in SF3B1 R625 and K700E mutants compared with wild-type uveal melanomas and breast cancer 6,8. To validate these alternatively spliced genes in mucosal melanomas, we tested SF3B1 R625H-mutant (n=2) and wild-type (n=3) patient-derived xenografts established from our mucosal melanoma primary samples. Uveal melanoma cell lines Mel202 (SF3B1 R625G) and MP41 (SF3B1 wild-type) were utilized as positive and negative controls, respectively, for differential splicing analysis. This analysis identified all seven genes to be differentially spliced in mucosal melanomas with SF3B1 mutant as compared with wild-type samples (Fig. 4b‚Äìe and Supplementary Fig. 2, http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/Mucosal_Melanoma/MucosalData/). This demonstrates that SF3B1 R625-mutant mucosal melanomas are functionally involved in alternative splicing of genes, similar to SF3B1 R625 and K700E mutants found in uveal melanoma and breast cancer.
Correlation of SF3B1-mutant mucosal melanomas with clinical outcome
The clinical data for patients harboring all SF3B1 mutations is summarized in Table 1. Of the eight patients with SF3B1 mutations, five had developed metastatic disease and had relatively longer survival times compared with those patients with wild-type SF3B1. However, the number of patients is too small to make any definitive statements.
Discussion
Mucosal melanomas represent a small fraction of the total melanoma patient population, and understanding their mutational landscape is important in developing more effective treatment(s) for this unique group of patients. This has been, and remains, a formidable challenge 4,5. They often present late, are difficult to diagnose, and have a poor prognosis compared with cutaneous melanoma. Until recently, there was little understanding about the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of these diseases.
In accordance with prior studies, we found a low frequency of the known driver mutations commonly found in cutaneous melanomas (Fig. 1). Mutations in BRAF were seen but these were not the driver V600 mutations described in cutaneous melanoma (Table 1). Similar to other studies 7, frequent mutations in KIT were found, especially in the vulvovaginal and anorectal subtypes. In these two groups of patients, the KIT mutations were comutated with NF1 in 32% of the samples. We also noted that a large percentage (80%) of the nasopharyngeal group was pan negative, meaning they lacked the common driver mutation classifications of BRAF, NRAS, NF1, or KIT. The frequency of the pan-negative genotype in nasopharyngeal melanomas was also higher than that seen in our cutaneous melanoma database (19%) (Fig. 2).
Activating mutations in KIT have been previously described in mucosal melanomas, and occasionally patients respond to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib 21. In the present study, KIT mutations, particularly in the vulvovaginal and anorectal subtypes, were often comutated with NF1, 22 and 60%, respectively. NF1 is a tumor suppressor that normally suppresses RAS signaling. Mutations in NF1 also activate RAS signaling, similar to some of the KIT mutations. Interestingly, mutations in either NF1 or KIT have been implicated as pivotal for the development of gastrointestinal stromal tumors 21. Comutations of KIT and NF1 have also been reported in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, although they are rare 21. We reason that mutations in either gene may only weakly activate the downstream signaling, and not be sufficient for tumorigenesis, whereas comutations in both genes lead to stronger and sufficient activation for tumor development. We contemplate whether combinations of inhibitors of MAPK and PI3K signaling may be explored for these patients.
NF1 mutations have also been found concurrent with BRAF mutations in melanoma, and loss of NF1 can contribute to melanoma resistance to BRAF inhibitors (ref). In addition, loss of NF1 can cooperate with mutated BRAF to promote melanocyte proliferation and tumorigenesis 22. We conjecture that mutations in NF1 may also contribute to the resistance to imatinib in some KIT-mutated mucosal melanoma. Further investigation is needed to determine whether there is cooperation between KIT and NF1 mutations in mucosal melanoma to uncover new areas for therapy.
Another important and intriguing finding was the high frequency of mutations in SF3B1, subunit 1 of splicing factor 3b. SF3B1 is a part of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U2 snRNP) complex along with p14 and U2AF65, which plays a key role in the early stages of pre-mRNA splicing by facilitating branch point recognition and selection of the 3‚Ä≤ splice site (Fig. 3c) 23. SF3B1 mutations have previously been described in myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), breast cancer, and uveal melanomas, within exons 12‚Äì15, which correspond to the C-terminal HEAT domain of SF3B1 (Fig. 4a) 6,17,24. SF3B1 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene in cancer and is mutated in 20% of hematological malignancies (myelodysplastic syndrome and CLL), 18% of uveal melanomas, 5% of pancreatic cancers, 1.8% of breast cancers, and less than 1% in cutaneous melanoma 8,17,25‚Äì27. The frequency of mutations in SF3B1 in this study (8/19, 42%) is higher than that reported in any other cancer type (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, we identified that mutations in other spliceosome pathway genes occurred at a higher frequency in mucosal melanoma as compared with our 135 sun-exposed cutaneous melanomas (Fig. 3b). We observed that patient 1 harbored the most mutations in our cohort; this may explain the higher comutation rate of SF3B1 with other spliceosomal component genes. For other patients, the mutations could be detected and predicted to be nonsynonymous and deleterious by the algorithms. Future work will be needed to determine their functional roles in the splicing process in mucosal melanoma.
In our study, seven (37%) of the mucosal melanoma patients carried the recurrent SF3B1 mutation at codon 625 (Fig. 4a). Five of the mucosal melanoma patients harbored the mutation R625H, which is also a common mutation found in uveal melanoma 17. The other two patients carried mutation R625C in SF3B1, and one variant R625S. A recent targeted sequencing of 15 anorectal mucosal melanoma patients described five patients with the identical SF3B1 R625 mutation, confirming our findings 7. WES in cutaneous melanoma found only a very low frequency of SF3B1 R625H/C mutations, 2/231 cutaneous patient samples 14. A review of our WES database of 135 cutaneous melanoma patients revealed no other mutations in SF3B1. A previous study found four patients with SF3B1 mutation in 20 desmoplastic melanoma patient; none of these mutations was at codon 625 28.
Recent studies have elucidated a functional role for recurrent hotspot mutations found in the C-terminal HEAT domains in SF3B1, indicating that these mutations result in alternative splicing, primarily by inducing aberrant 3‚Ä≤ splice site selection 19,27. Thus, it was hypothesized that the SF3B1 R625 mutation results in differential interaction with the pre-mRNA or other splicing factors of the U2 snRNP complex, such as p14 or U2AF65, resulting in binding to a noncanonical branch point, thus facilitating alternative 3‚Ä≤ splice site selection 19,29. Furthermore, approximately half of the aberrantly spliced mRNAs are subject to non-sense-mediated decay resulting in the downregulation of gene and protein expression 19. However, the functional role of alternatively spliced genes that do not undergo non-sense-mediated decay remains to be determined, as it is possible that these aberrant transcripts are processed into aberrant proteins with altered functions.
In our current study, we show for the first time that SF3B1 mutations in mucosal melanoma are associated with alternative splicing (Fig. 4b‚Äìe and Supplementary Fig. 2, http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/Mucosal_Melanoma/MucosalData/). Utilizing qRT-PCR, we analyzed seven previously reported genes to be alternatively spliced in SF3B1-mutant uveal melanoma and breast cancer. We validated all these genes to be differentially spliced in mucosal melanoma, highlighting a functional role for mutations in SF3B1. Specifically, we found ABCC5, CRNDE, RPL31, and TMEM14C, in which the alternatively spliced variants were highly expressed in SF3B1 mutant as compared with wild-type mucosal melanoma samples. ABCC5 encodes for an ABC transport protein that is involved in multidrug resistance, and was observed to retain introns in SF3B1 wild-type uveal melanoma samples, but not in SF3B1-mutant samples perhaps due to increased splicing efficiency 6. We validated this finding in our SF3B1-mutant mucosal melanoma samples (Fig. 4b). CRNDE is a long noncoding RNA and has been shown to be associated with development and found to be upregulated in colorectal cancer and leukemias 30. We found that the ratio of the alternative spliced form of CRNDE compared with the canonical spliced form is higher in SF3B1-mutant samples (Fig. 4c). In common with SF3B1-mutant breast cancer tumors, we also observed differential splicing of RPL31, a ribosomal protein found to be overexpressed in colorectal tumors in familial adenomatous polyposis patients (Fig. 4d) 31. We observed a higher expression of RPL31 in SF3B1-mutant samples (Fig. 4d). Finally, we also observed a higher ratio of the differentially spliced form of TMEM14C, a transmembrane protein important for heme biosynthesis, in SF3B1-mutant samples (Fig. 4e). Further experiments are needed to elucidate the role of these differentially spliced genes expressed in SF3B1-mutant mucosal melanomas.
Interestingly, SF3B1 wild-type overexpression in cell lines does not recapitulate the alternative splicing events induced by SF3B1 mutant, indicating that mutations in SF3B1 are neomorphic 19,23. Using an inducible genetic inhibition model, Zhou et al.32 identified that selective inhibition of SF3B1 mutant, but not wild-type alleles, resulted in differential splicing without effecting cell growth. However, inhibition of SF3B1 wild-type resulted in growth inhibition in vitro, indicating that cells are reliant on SF3B1 wild-type for growth 32. Alternatively, SF3B1-mutant pancreatic cells were found to be more sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of SF3B1 as compared with wild-type 8. Thus, it remains to be determined whether the effects of inhibition of SF3B1 are dependent on SF3B1 mutational status and tumor type. Recently, a phase I study of E7101, a novel spliceosome inhibitor, whose main target is SF3B1, has begun in solid tumors 33. Other preclinical leads of SF3B1 inhibitors are currently being developed by the pharmaceutical industry 34‚Äì36. Identifying the effects of SF3B1 inhibition in mucosal melanoma may open new avenues for the treatment of mucosal melanomas with an SF3B1 mutation.
There were too few patients in our study to make significant survival correlations between patients with SF3B1 mutations and those with wild-type SF3B1. The presence of SF3B1 mutations in CLL correlates to a worse prognosis, whereas SF3B1 hotspot mutations appear to correlate with better prognosis in uveal melanomas 17,24. More patient samples are needed to establish the correlation between SF3B1 mutation and overall survival in mucosal melanomas.
For future work, we plan to perform RNA sequencing in the mucosal melanoma samples to compare the alternatively spliced transcripts in SF3B1 mutant as compared with wild-type as previously described 19,23. In addition, as a part of our future research, we plan to test and validate the splicing transcripts in fresh tumors (when we received new patients) or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (archival samples).
In summary, this study is the largest cohort of mucosal melanomas reported with WES. This provides new insight into the mutational landscape of these rare subtypes of melanoma. We identified comutations of KIT and NF1 (32%), as well as recurrent SF3B1 mutations (42%). SF3B1 mutations have not been previously reported in vulvovaginal or nasopharyngeal mucosal melanoma, and only once previous study found mutations in anorectal mucosal melanoma using targeted sequencing 7. In addition, our report is the first study in demonstrating the functional role of SF3B1 R625 mutations inducing alternative splicing in mucosal melanoma. Future studies will focus on the wide spread effects of SF3B1 mutations on aberrant mRNA isoforms, and the effect of alternate splicing on tumor progression in mucosal melanoma. These findings advance our understanding of mucosal melanoma and offer potential targetable mutations that could improve treatment for these rare forms of melanoma.Acknowledgements

Dermatofibrosarcoma ProtuberansGopal Menon; Jennifer Brooks; Michael L. Ramsey.Author Information and AffiliationsAuthorsGopal Menon; Jennifer Brooks1; Michael L. Ramsey2.Affiliations1 Geisinger2 Geisinger Health SystemLast Update: April 18, 2024.Continuing Education ActivityDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) stands as a rare soft tissue sarcoma that emerges in the dermis and is often found on the trunk and proximal extremities. This condition can present as a slowly developing, robust plaque, exhibiting shades of pink or violet, underscoring the challenge of timely diagnosis. The chromosomal translocation t(17;22)(q22;q13) leads to the formation of the abnormal fusion protein COL1A1-PDGFB, contributing to its pathogenesis. Surgical excision, whether through Mohs micrographic surgery or wide local excision, remains the cornerstone of treatment. However, the potential for local recurrence necessitates vigilant monitoring posttreatment, with radiation therapy sometimes employed to mitigate this risk. Emerging treatments such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors show promise in managing advanced or metastatic disease, highlighting the evolving landscape of DFSP management.Healthcare professionals engaging in this comprehensive course on DFSP gain invaluable insights into its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management. Through a deeper understanding of DFSP's molecular underpinnings and clinical behavior, clinicians enhance their diagnostic acumen, facilitating earlier recognition and biopsy. Moreover, the course equips learners with proficiency in employing various treatment modalities, including surgical techniques like Mohs micrographic surgery and wide local excision. Also explored is the importance of collaboration with an interprofessional team, as this amplifies the effectiveness of patient care because diverse expertise contributes to informed decision-making and comprehensive treatment planning. By integrating multidisciplinary approaches, healthcare providers optimize patient outcomes by minimizing the risk of local recurrence and addressing advanced or metastatic disease more effectively.
Objectives:
Differentiate dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans from other skin lesions, such as dermatofibromas and other soft tissue sarcomas, based on characteristic features and immunohistochemical staining patterns.Select appropriate diagnostic modalities, including biopsy techniques and molecular testing, into the diagnostic workup of patients suspected of having dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.Implement evidence-based treatment approaches, such as surgical excision with wide margins, Mohs micrographic surgery, radiation therapy, and targeted therapies, in managing dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.Collaborate with interdisciplinary team members to improve care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.
Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.
IntroductionDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is an uncommon soft tissue sarcoma primarily found on the trunk and proximal extremities that typically appears as a slowly progressing, firm, violet-red, or blue plaque.¬†Because DFSP is a slow-growing tumor, the diagnosis is often delayed for months to years. Most cases of DFSP are associated with a t(17;22) (q22;q13) translocation, generating the fusion protein COL1A1-PDGFB.Extensive local infiltration, extending well beyond the visible lesion, characterizes DSFP, with distant metastasis being rare unless fibrosarcomatous transformation occurs. Surgical excision with clear margins is the preferred treatment, utilizing techniques like Mohs micrographic surgery or wide local excision.Radiation therapy can decrease local recurrence, particularly in cases where wide margins are impractical. More recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown promising response rates in patients with advanced or metastatic disease.[1] Patients require vigilant monitoring for local recurrence following curative treatment.EtiologyNinety percent of patients with DFSP, including those who develop the fibrosarcomatous variant (DFSP-FS), have the t(17;22)(q22;q13) translocation.[2]¬†An alternative translocation involving the platelet-derived growth factor subunit B (PDGFB) gene on chromosome 22 may be present in patients without the t(17;22)(q22;q13) translocation. In certain instances, the progression from DFSP to DFSP-FS is associated with genomic gain affecting the PDGFB/COL1A1 fusion gene, although this occurrence is variable.Furthermore, researchers have noted the occurrence of microsatellite instability, characterized by alterations in the number of repeated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) bases within microsatellites or short, repetitive DNA sequences compared to the inherited state. Subsequently, these instances of microsatellite instability are accompanied by the acquisition of tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutations, particularly in cases displaying features of high-grade sarcomaEpidemiologyDFSP is a rare tumor, occurring at a rate of 0.8 to 4.5 cases per million persons annually and represents 1% to 6% of all soft tissue sarcomas and 18% of cutaneous soft tissue sarcomas‚Äîaffecting both genders equally. Some studies report a slight predominance in med. While most commonly diagnosed in adults between the third and fifth decades, DFSP can manifest across all age groups. Children account for 6% of all cases of DFSP. This tumor may exhibit accelerated growth during pregnancy.[3]¬†DFSP-FS accounts for 5% to 15% of all DFSPs, and the Bednar or pigmented variant represents fewer than 5% of all DFSP cases. DFSP, including the pigmented variant, is more common in Black individuals than White.[4]¬†PathophysiologyThe t(17;22)(q22;q13) translocation results in the formation of supernumerary ring chromosomes from chromosome 22 and contains low-level amplified sequences from 17q22-qter and 22q10-q13.1.[4][5]¬†Less commonly, a linear derivative of chromosome 22 may also be implicated.[6]¬†The ring chromosomes and the translocated linear derivative of chromosome 22 harbor a fusion gene where¬†PDGFB¬†merges with the collagen type 1A1 (COL1A1) gene. The usually suppressed¬†PDGFB¬†now becomes activated by the¬†COL1A1¬†promoter. This genetic rearrangement induces¬†PDGFB¬†upregulation, resulting in excessive platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) production, continuous activation of the tyrosine kinase PDGFRB receptor, cellular proliferation, and tumor development.[7]HistopathologyDFSP is poorly circumscribed and usually involves the dermis and subcutis, although rare cases can be limited to the dermis (see Image.¬†Dermatofibrosarcoma Protruberans, Low-Power Field). Due to the possibility of distant metastasis and aggressive local invasion, DFSP is considered an intermediate tumor between a benign dermatofibroma and a frank fibrosarcoma. Transformation to a high-grade sarcoma is extremely rare. The overlying epidermis does not show any atypical histological features.[8]¬†The spindle-shaped tumor cells of DFSP are arranged in a storiform or woven pattern, parallel to the epidermal surface, and have little pleomorphism and scant cytoplasm (see Image.¬†Hematoxylin and Eosin Stain Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans). The cells are surrounded by collagenous stroma, sometimes associated with hyaline or myxoid changes. The characteristic honeycomb appearance results from irregular tentacle-like projections infiltrating the underlying subcutaneous tissue, traversing the septa and fat, leading to fat entrapment. DFSP typically extends into subcutaneous fat but seldom involves fascia, muscle, or bone unless recurrent or long-standing. Necrosis is uncommon. While mitoses are present, no significant mitotic activity is present, and atypical mitoses are rare. A mitotic count that reaches 10 mitoses per 10 high power field (HPF) and tumor size correlates with metastatic spread. About one-fifth of all DFSPs undergo fibrosarcomatous transformation, which appears as an expansive tumor with fascicular and herringbone patterns and atypical cytological features.[9][10]History and PhysicalDFSP typically manifests as an asymptomatic, skin-colored to red-brown firm plaque, eventually progressing to multiple raised nodules with a violaceous to red-brown hue (see¬†Image.¬†Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans). The pigmented variant often presents with irregular brown pigmentation, and the atrophic variant appears as a violaceous plaque resembling morphea or scar tissue. Lesions exhibit slow growth over months to years, occasionally resembling keloids or dermatofibromas, leading to misdiagnosis, particularly in the early stages. As the tumor progresses, it may reach several centimeters in diameter, potentially accompanied by telangiectasia in the surrounding or overlying skin. The tumor is typically fixed to the dermis but can freely move in relation to underlying structures. Later in the disease, the tumor may become fixed to underlying structures. Rarely, DFSP can arise from preexisting scars or tattoos. As lesions enlarge, some may ulcerate and become painful. Nearly 50% of lesions are on the trunk, followed by 35% on the extremities, and 15% on the head and neck.[11]¬†EvaluationHealthcare professionals should consider DFSP in individuals presenting with a slow-growing cutaneous nodule. Dermoscopy is the initial assessment tool, offering suggestive but not conclusive evidence. A core needle or excisional biopsy provides a definitive diagnosis. Patients should undergo a comprehensive history and physical examination, including an assessment of lymph nodes and a complete skin examination. Those with a prior treatment history may undergo a fine needle aspiration.Typically, examining a hematoxylin and eosin-stained specimen by light microscopy can diagnose DFSP. In some cases, clinicians may find distinguishing DFSP from other neoplasms like dermatofibroma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, undifferentiated or unclassified soft tissue sarcoma, or atypical fibroxanthoma challenging. All cases of suspected DFSP should undergo confirmatory immunohistochemistry testing. DFSP stains positive for CD34 in 80% to 100% of cases (see¬†Image.¬†Cellular Dermatofibroma). Hyaluronate and vimentin are typically also positive. DFSP stains negative for factor XIIIa, smooth muscle actin, desmin, S100 proteins, and keratins.Molecular testing using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect the t(17;22)(q22;q13) translocation is available. Both have a similar specificity of 100%, but FISH is more sensitive than RT-PCR for detecting the¬†PDGFB/COL1A1¬†transcript at 90% versus 72%, respectively. Molecular testing is necessary when the diagnosis is unclear or to predict the likelihood of response to treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.Because most cases of DFSP are superficial, clinicians can assess the extent of tumor and lymph node involvement by physical examination. Imaging is not a routine part of the diagnostic process. Occasionally, imaging may be helpful for large or recurrent tumors if the clinician suspects bone invasion or needs to define the extent of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice.[12][13][14][15]¬†Computed tomography (CT) is only helpful if underlying bone involvement or lung metastases are suspected. The lung is the most common site of metastasis via hematogenous spread, and regional lymph nodes are rarely involved. Due to the unlikely occurrence of lymphatic and hematogenous dissemination, an extensive staging workup is not generally necessary. Some authors suggest obtaining a radiograph or CT scan of the lungs before treatment, though the National Comprehensive Cancer Network does not make specific recommendations regarding a staging evaluation.[16][17]Treatment / ManagementThe initial treatment for localized DFSP is surgical resection with negative margins.[18]¬†The size and location of the tumor determine the best surgical approach. Regional lymph node dissection is unnecessary, given the low risk of metastasis. The risk of inadequate initial resection is high due to the delay in diagnosis and the tumor's ability to invade surrounding tissues. Nearly 50% of patients will experience local recurrence with simple excision. Recurrent tumors are more likely to invade fascia, muscle, or bone and result in distant metastases.[19][20]¬†For these reasons, pathological negative margins are necessary.¬†
Wide Local Excision
Wide local excision (WLE) is an option for resection. The resection margins are essential in determining the risk of local recurrence. Tentacle-like tumor projections can extend beyond 3 cm of the primary tumor. Results from one study reveal the local recurrence in patients with a resection margin less than 3 cm is 47% compared to 7% in patients with margins of 3 to 5 cm.[20][21][22]¬†The NCCN recommends margins of 2 to 4 cm with clear pathologic margins when clinically feasible.
Mohs Micrographic Surgery
Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) involves the progressive horizontal slicing of tissue during resection, coupled with immediate microscopic evaluation via frozen section analysis. Microscopic evaluation includes prompt immunostaining for CD34 until achieving a clear margin. Real-time microscopic examination of margins reduces the likelihood of positive margins. Some studies propose that MMS may result in lower local recurrence rates than WLE for DFSP. Notably, DFSP treated with WLE exhibits a recurrence rate of approximately 7.3%, contrasting with the 1% recurrence rate observed with MMS treatment.[23][24]¬†However, randomized trials and comprehensive long-term data are required to confirm these findings. A significant benefit of MMS is the smaller required lateral margins, resulting in more minor wounds and less complex reconstruction. MMS is a good option for cosmetically sensitive areas, where achieving narrow margins is preferable.¬†
Radiation Therapy
DFSP is radiosensitive tumor. Radiation therapy is rarely used alone in the treatment of DFSP.¬†Current NCCN guidelines recommend the use of adjuvant radiation in the following settings:Positive margins after surgical resectionNegative margins, with the closest margin being less than 1 cm in patients who did not undergo MMSFor recurrent or metastatic disease when surgical excision is not feasible¬†[25]The doses of radiation range from 50 to 70 Gy and typically extend 3 to 5 cm beyond the surgical margin when feasible.[26]
Molecularly Targeted Therapy
Imatinib inhibits the PDGF receptor and other receptor tyrosine kinases such as c-KIT. Imatinib has the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic DFSP.[27]¬†Imatinib competitively inhibits adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding to the PDGFB receptor, slowing down kinase activity, limiting tumor growth, and promoting apoptosis. Patients with the t(17;22)(q22;q13) translocation show a more significant response to imatinib, and thus, screening for this translocation should be performed before initiating therapy. Further studies are necessary to see if patients without the translocation will benefit from imatinib.Adverse effects associated with imatinib include gastrointestinal upset, edema, fatigue, anemia, and rash. Most patients with DFSP with translocation respond favorably to imatinib therapy, with studies suggesting a response rate of approximately 65%. The duration of therapy varies. Some sources recommend 6 months of therapy, which may be extended.[28][29]¬†Additional research is necessary to determine the potential integration of imatinib into the surgical approach for localized DFSP.¬†
Posttreatment Surveillance
Patients should participate in regular self-examination, and the primary site should be examined every 6 months for 3 to 5 years. Lifelong examination annually follows. Radiographic surveillance, blood counts, and liver function testing are necessary only if symptoms dictate. Metastatic lesions are most likely to occur with recurrent lesions that have progressed for many years and when a fibrosarcomatous component is present. Some authors recommend limiting follow-up imaging examinations to those with recurrent DFSP or DFSP-FS.¬†Differential DiagnosisThe following list contains the differential diagnoses for DFSP:Cellular fibrous histiocytomaSolitary fibrous tumorSpindle cell lipomaAngiosarcomaPeripheral nerve sheath tumorsSpindle cell melanomaAngiomyxomaMyxoid sarcomaSynovial sarcomaSarcomatoid carcinoma¬†Cutaneous melanomaDermatofibromaDermatologic metastatic carcinomaEpidermal inclusion cystKeloidMorphea¬†[17]PrognosisThe prognosis for DFSP is generally favorable, with a 10-year survival rate of 99.1%. However, patients with metastatic disease typically survive approximately 2 years post-diagnosis. The overall risk for the development of metastatic disease is 5%, including 1% with regional lymph node metastasis and 4% with distant metastasis.¬†While metastasis remains uncommon, local recurrence poses a more prevalent concern for morbidity. Features that increase the risk of a poor prognosis are patients older than 50, DFSP-FS, a high mitotic index, and increased cellularity.[30] A wider surgical excision improves the overall prognosis.¬†¬†ComplicationsComplications of DFSP primarily stem from the extent of the surgical defect and issues linked to local recurrence. Common complications include wound-related problems such as infections, challenges in covering the defect necessitating skin grafting or complex plastic surgery procedures, contractures, keloid formation, and suboptimal cosmesis. Employing MMS aids in mitigating these complications. Death is an uncommon but possible complication in patients who develop metastatic disease.Deterrence and Patient EducationDFSP is a relatively uncommon soft tissue neoplasm that is locally aggressive but rarely metastasizes. Healthcare professionals should emphasize the significance of regular skin examinations and seeking medical evaluation for any suspicious lesions, which can facilitate early detection and improve outcomes. Patients should be educated about the appearance of DFSP, emphasizing that the tumor may present as a small, asymptomatic papule or nonindurated patch that gradually enlarges over months to years. The slow progression often delays diagnosis, emphasizing the importance of promptly reporting any changes in skin lesions to healthcare professionals.Before undergoing treatment, patients should understand that surgical excision is the preferred course of action and should be aware of potential risks, such as unsatisfactory cosmetic results. Additionally, patients should be informed about the low likelihood of metastasis but the high potential for local recurrence after resection. Clinicians should encourage patients to adhere to scheduled follow-up appointments for continuous monitoring, promoting timely intervention and optimal management of DFSP. Through comprehensive patient education and proactive deterrence strategies, clinicians can empower individuals to take an active role in their skin health and facilitate early detection and treatment of DFSP.Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes DFSP is an uncommon soft tissue sarcoma primarily found on the trunk and proximal extremities. This tumor typically presents as a slowly progressing, firm plaque with a violet-red, brown, or blue hue. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion as these lesions are slow-growing and may go unrecognized for long periods. Healthcare professionals caring for patients with DFSP must be proficient in recognizing the characteristics of DFSP and accurately interpreting diagnostic tests such as biopsies and imaging studies.Characterized by extensive local infiltration, DFSP may extend well beyond visible lesions, although distant metastasis is rare unless fibrosarcomatous transformation occurs. The preferred treatment is surgical excision with clear margins, utilizing techniques like WLE and MMS. Adjunctive radiation therapy can reduce local recurrence, particularly in cases where wide margins are impractical. Emerging treatments such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors show promising response rates in patients with advanced or metastatic DFSP. Developing a comprehensive care plan tailored to each patient's unique needs is essential. This strategy should involve a combination of surgical excision, radiation therapy, or pharmacotherapy, depending on the stage, location, and extent of the DFSP lesion. Patients require vigilant monitoring for local recurrence posttreatment. Awareness of DFSP's varied presentation and treatment modalities is crucial for timely diagnosis and management.To enhance patient-centered care, outcomes, patient safety, and team performance related to DFSP, physicians, advanced practice practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals must collaborate effectively using a multidisciplinary approach. Effective communication¬†is critical for coordinating care and ensuring seamless transitions between different phases of treatment. Team members should regularly communicate updates on patient status, treatment plans, and any changes in the care plan. Clear and concise communication helps prevent errors, reduces the risk of complications, and promotes patient safety. By leveraging their collective skills, implementing effective strategies, communicating openly, coordinating care seamlessly, and fostering a culture of collaboration, healthcare professionals can enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, ensure patient safety, and optimize team performance in the management of DFSP. ¬†Review Questions

IntroductionKaposi sarcoma is an interesting soft tissue tumor occurring in several distinct populations with a variety of presentations and courses. In its most well-known form, Kaposi sarcoma occurs in patients with immunosuppression, such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDs) or those undergoing immunosuppression due to an organ transplant. Initially described in 1872 by Moritz Kaposi, an Austro-Hungarian dermatologist in 5 patients with the multifocal disease,[1]¬†human herpesvirus/Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (HHV-8) was discovered as a causative agent of Kaposi sarcoma as the AIDS epidemic progressed in the 1980s.[2]¬†Four clinical forms emerged.Classic form occurring in elderly men of Mediterranean and Eastern European descent on the lower extremitiesEndemic African form with generalized lymph node involvement occurring in childrenHIV-related form occurring with patients not taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with diffuse involvement of the skin and internal organsIatrogenic form in immunosuppressed patients also with diffuse involvement of the skin and internal organsEach form has a differing natural history ranging from indolent to more aggressive and fatal in anaplastic varieties.[3]EtiologyHuman herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is present in all forms of Kaposi sarcoma.[4]¬†HHV-8 interferes with many normal cell functions and requires cofactors like cytokines or specific proteins to result in the development of Kaposi sarcoma.[5]¬†Other malignancies associated with HHV-8 include plasmablastic multicentric Castleman disease, primary effusion lymphoma, intravascular large B cell lymphoma, and occasionally angiosarcoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.[5]EpidemiologyClassic Kaposi sarcoma has a male: female ratio 17:1 and occurs primarily in patients over 50 years old of Eastern European and Mediterranean descent. These patients are at greater risk for secondary malignancies.[6][7]¬† The prevalence mirrors the distribution of HHV-8 throughout the world.[8]¬†Within the United States, incidence has been stable around 1:100,000 since 1997.[9]Endemic Kaposi sarcoma has the unusual predilection for the pediatric population and mirrors HHV-8 seropositivity.[6]¬†The rates of seropositivity in pediatric patients vary extensively throughout Africa, from a low of 2% in Eritrea to almost 100% in the Central African Republic.[10]¬†Following the HIV epidemic in Africa, the ratio of men to women with Kaposi sarcoma has fallen from 7:1 to 2:1.[11]¬†Endemic Kaposi sarcoma is now the most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in women with Uganda and Zimbabwe.[11]HHV-8 seropositivity worldwide varies, with a high of 40% in Saharan Africa to 2% to 4% in Northern Europe, Southeast Asia, and Caribbean countries. Approximately 10% of Mediterranean countries and 5-20% of United States patients are seropositive for HHV-8.[12][13]¬†This unique predilection for sub-Saharan African, the Mediterranean, and South America is unique to HHV-8 amongst human herpesviruses.[14]AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma is the second most common tumor in HIV patients with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3 and is an AIDs-defining illness.[15]¬†Up to 30% of HIV patients not taking high-activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART) will develop Kaposi sarcoma. HIV positive male homosexuals have a 5- to 10-fold increased the risk of Kaposi sarcoma.[16][6]Iatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma has a male: female ratio of 3:1 [6]. Over 5% of transplant patients who develop a de novo malignancy will develop Kaposi sarcoma, a 400- to 500-fold increased risk over the general population.[17][18]¬†Patients with bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant have much lower risks of developing Kaposi sarcoma compared to solid organ transplant patients.[18][6]PathophysiologyHHV-8 is a double-stranded enveloped DNA virus with 6 major subtypes (A-F).[9]Due to HHV-8 co-evolving with the human population for centuries, cofactors of immune defects and inflammation are required for the development of malignancy.[14]¬†It is transmitted primarily via saliva in childhood and sexually, with some cases of infection via blood transfusion or intravenous drug use.[14]¬†Seropositive family members will often infect other family members, particularly in areas where HHV-8 is endemic.[14][6]After infecting endothelial cells, HHV-8 activates the mTOR pathway, alters the cells to have mesenchymal differentiation, and promotes aberrant angiogenesis [14]. Through immune suppression and inflammation, the HHV-8 infected cells can persist and proliferate. Expression of latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) causes binding of p53 and suppression of apoptosis [14][19]. LANA also maintains the viral episome and prevents Fas-induced programmed cell death.[19]¬†NF-kB is activated by HHV-8 and up-regulates cytokine expression. Up-regulation of VEGF and bFGF results in neo-angiogenesis [19]. It induces c-kit expression and produces the spindled morphology of Kaposi sarcoma cells from their original cuboidal monolayer.[19]¬†Matrix metalloproteinases are upregulated by HHV-8.[19]Interestingly, Kaposi sarcoma is not monoclonal and different nodules within a patient have different clonal origins.[14]Clinically, Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular lesion, and as such,¬†often presents as a violaceous pink to purple plaque on the skin or mucocutaneous surfaces. Lesions may be painful with associated lymphedema and secondary infection.[6][19]¬†There are 3 major stages on the skin: patch, plaque, and nodule.[20]¬†Lesions may ulcerate or invade into nearby tissues.[20]¬†In addition to involving lymph nodes, Kaposi sarcoma has a predilection for the lungs and gastrointestinal system, but can also occur in other visceral organs.[20]¬†Respiratory involvement can be associated with death due Kaposi sarcoma.[19]HistopathologyKaposi sarcoma progresses through 3 distinct clinical stages: patch, plaque, and nodular.The patch stage of Kaposi sarcoma is characterized by a spindle cell proliferation of irregular, complex vascular channels dissecting through the dermis with the promontory sign, defined as ramifying proliferating vessels surrounding larger ectatic pre-existing vessels and skin adnexa.[20][3]¬†Extravasated red blood cells, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, rare hyaline globules, and perivascular lymphocytes and plasma cells are also frequently identified.Advancement to the plaque stage of Kaposi sarcoma has an increasing prominence of the features seen in the patch stage with extension into the subcutis, and more prominence of the hyaline globules intra- and extra-cellularly.[20][3]¬†These hyaline globules are periodic acid-Schiff positive and demonstrate Weibel-Palade bodies by electron microscopy.[20]¬†Cellular pleomorphism is minimal, and there are few mitotic figures.[20][3]As Kaposi sarcoma develops into the nodular form, the pleomorphism increases and mitotic figures become more prominent [3]. The slit-like lumens¬†are enhanced¬†as¬†well.[20][3]Histologic variants of Kaposi sarcoma include: in situ Kaposi sarcoma, anaplastic Kaposi sarcoma, lymphangiectatic Kaposi sarcoma, bullous Kaposi sarcoma, ecchymotic Kaposi sarcoma, glomeruloid Kaposi sarcoma, and hyperkeratotic Kaposi sarcoma.[20]The¬†presence of HHV-8 can be confirmed with immunohistochemistry for LANA1.[14]History and PhysicalA general history and physical are performed first. The skin is examined for purplish lesions or lymph node enlargement that may signal the presence of¬†Kaposi sarcoma. Suspicious lesions on the skin or lymph nodes can be biopsied and sent to pathology for evaluation. Particular¬†care and attention should be paid to mucocutaneous surfaces as it is a common presenting location.EvaluationFor a definitive diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma, they must perform a biopsy or excision of the suspicious areas. A pathologist examines the tissue under the microscope and looks for the characteristic features: a spindle cell vascular proliferation in the dermis.[20][3]¬†Immunohistochemistry positivity for LANA1 (a surrogate marker for HHV-8) helps to differentiate Kaposi sarcoma from similar lesions. The lesional cells also express CD34, factor VIII, PECAM-1, D2-40, VEGFR-3, and BCL-2.[20]Treatment / ManagementSkin involvement of Kaposi sarcoma is treated by local excision, liquid nitrogen, and injection of vincristine.[19][6]¬†Chemotherapy is a mainstay of treatment for endemic and systemic forms, in particular in children.[6][9]Patients with HIV-related Kaposi sarcoma respond well to HAART,[21][22]¬†which can cause regression or complete treatment of their sarcoma. In patients with severe Kaposi sarcoma, combines HAART with chemotherapy.[23]¬†Iatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma treatment must balance a reduction in immune suppression or withdrawal of steroid treatment with transplant rejection and treatment of the sarcoma.[9]Differential DiagnosisHistologically, spindle cell vascular lesions in the skin include a differential diagnosis of[20][3]:Interstitial granuloma annulareSpindle cell hemangiomaAcquired tufted angiomaKaposiform hemangioendotheliomaCutaneous angiosarcomaFibrosarcomatous dermatofibrosarcoma protuberansAneurysmal dermatofibromaAcroangiodermatitisSpindle cell melanomaHigh-grade sarcomasThe differential diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma on mucocutaneous surfaces includes[6]:NeviPyogenic granulomaBacillary angiomatosisHemangiomaAngiosarcomaMelanomaRadiation OncologyClassical Kaposi sarcoma tends to be radiosensitive, especially in early stages of the disease. Dosages recommended are 15.2 Gy for oral lesions, 20 Gy for conjunctiva, eyelids, lips, hands, feet, penis, and anal regions, and 30 Gy with hypofractionation¬†for other parts of the body.[21]¬†For later stages of Kaposi sarcoma, radiation treatment may be used palliatively to reduce pain, edema, and bleeding.[21]Pertinent Studies and Ongoing TrialsThalidomide, VEGF inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and matrix metalloproteinases are currently¬†under investigation as single agents to treat Kaposi sarcoma.[6][24]¬†Several studies are currently¬†ongoing for new and novel treatment for Kaposi sarcoma, including[25]:Intra-lesional nivolumab for cutaneous Kaposi sarcomaPomalidomide with liposomal doxorubicin for refractory Kaposi sarcomaPembrolizumab for relapsed and refractory HIV related neoplasmsIpilimumab and nivolumab for advanced HIV related neoplasmsNelfinavir for endemic, classic, and HIV-related Kaposi sarcomaValganciclovir for HIV-related Kaposi sarcoma, particularly patients with immune reconstitution syndromeRecombinant EphB4-HAS fusion proteinSelumetinibMedical OncologyHigh-activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the mainstay of treatment in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma. Not only does HAART treatment reduce the risk of development of Kaposi sarcoma, but it also can lead to spontaneous regression of the tumors.[21][22]For local disease, sclerotherapy, intralesional vinca-alkaloids, bleomycin, interferon-alpha, topical alitretinoin, or imiquimod cream have all been used with success.[6]Systemic chemotherapy approved for treatment of Kaposi sarcoma includes liposomal anthracyclins, paclitaxel, etoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine, bleomycin, or a combination of doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vincristine.[19][6]¬†Others have used interferon-alpha 2b with success.[6]¬†Other therapies tried to include thalidomide, VEGF inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and matrix metalloproteinases but further research into these as single agents is still being conducted.[6][24]StagingKaposi sarcoma is not usually staged, however, a staging system was initially developed in the 1980s for HIV-related Kaposi sarcoma by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group.[26][13]¬†With modern HAART, there are 2 proposed risk categories: good and poor.[26]¬†Poor prognosis was based on poor tumor stage and poor systemic disease status.[26]PrognosisTen percent to 20% of patients with the classic form of Kaposi sarcoma will succumb from their disease, but another larger percentage will develop a secondary malignancy that may also be lethal.[3]¬†Endemic, HIV-related, and iatrogenic forms of Kaposi sarcoma have a variable prognosis. Prognosis may depend on CD4 count and opportunistic infections. In patients with iatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma, the prognosis is dependent on their underlying condition and their ability to tolerate a reduction in immunosuppression.[3]¬†Worse prognosis is usually found in patients with visceral organ involvement, particularly the lungs.[3][19]ComplicationsLarger lesions can be painful and lead to edema and disfigurement of the skin. Pulmonary involvement of Kaposi sarcoma can cause respiratory distress and lead to death. Classic Kaposi sarcoma has a known association with the development of a secondary malignancy.Chemotherapy is not without side effects, including but not limited to neurotoxicity, infertility, cardiac toxicity, and nerve pain.Radiation therapy can lead to drying of the skin, avascularity, poor healing, development of additional malignancies, and lymphedema.Postoperative and Rehabilitation CarePatients should be followed closely for resolution or recurrence of their disease.Pearls and Other IssuesThere are 4 major forms of Kaposi sarcoma: classic, endemic, HIV-related, and iatrogenic, each with a different patient population and presentation.All cases of Kaposi sarcoma harbor the HHV-8 virus, though this is not sufficient to cause the neoplasm.Histologically, Kaposi sarcoma presents as a spindle cell vascular neoplasm with extravasated red blood cells and hyaline globules.Immunohistochemistry for LANA-1 can confirm the presence of¬†HHV-8 in the neoplastic cells.Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Kaposi sarcoma has been definitively linked to HHV-8 infection with increased incidence in patients with HIV infection, immunosuppression, or of Eastern European or Mediterranean descent. In seropositive patients at high risk of development of Kaposi sarcoma, the primary care team should take care to perform thorough skin exams looking for the characteristic violaceous patches and plaques. Additionally, patients in these high-risk groups should be counseled to examine their skin as well for lesions. Discovery of any suspicious lesions should prompt expedient biopsy and examination by a pathologist. Patient care is enhanced by the submitting provider providing a complete clinical history and mentioning the suspicion for Kaposi sarcoma to the reviewing pathologist.Patients who are diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma should be closely monitored for disease regression or recurrence and need for radiation treatment or systemic chemotherapy. If the HIV-associated or iatrogenic form, the clinical team should communicate and work closely to begin HAART or help reduce the immunosuppression while treating the patients underlying condition. (Level I)Dentists and oral health care providers should be educated about the clinical presentation in the oral cavity as this a common location.Review Questions

IntroductionMicrocystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) is a rare malignant sweat gland tumor that commonly occurs on the head and neck. MAC has a¬†predilection for the central face but may be found¬†although it may be found on the trunk, axilla, extremities, and genitals.¬†MAC is characterized by its¬†slow growth¬†but local aggressiveness.[1]There are approximately 200 cases worldwide; however, it was Goldstein and others that first described MAC in 1982.¬†MAC has been mentioned under a number of names, including:Sclerosing sweat duct carcinoma (SSDC)Malignant syringomaSyringoid eccrine carcinomaEccrine epitheliomaSyringomatous carcinomaSweat gland carcinoma with syringomatous featuresThe tumor, known as syringomatous adenoma of the nipple, has been considered MAC; however, this is debated. MAC is known to have perineural invasion (upwards of 80%) with infiltration beyond clinically apparent margins. However, it has little metastatic potential but often recurs.EtiologyRisk factors have been identified for forming MAC:Ultraviolet (UV) radiationPrevious radiation therapyImmunosuppressive medicationsThe estimate for the link to therapeutic radiation ranges from 19% to 50%, with an average latent period of 30 to 40 years. UV radiation is often implicated¬†because most lesions appear in sun-exposed areas and those with Fitzpatrick skin types I and II.Microcystic adnexal carcinoma has also been reported in younger individuals with a history of additional UV exposure, such as fighter pilots.[2]The effect of immunosuppression on the risk for the development of MAC is unclear at this time, although immunosuppression increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.EpidemiologyMAC¬†tends to occur in adults 55 to 60 years old. However, it occasionally has occurred in children. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma arises¬†equally in males and females although some literature lists a slight female predominance.[3]PathophysiologyMicrocystic adnexal carcinoma often grows slowly and will present as a white to pink plaque located on the face. Often, it has been overlooked or ignored. Often it is confused with a basal cell carcinoma clinically. In such an instance, a shave biopsy is usually performed. However, in the case of microcystic adnexal carcinoma, the pathology lies deeper than a superficial shave biopsy will show. Thus, making the diagnosis more difficult. If suspected, a punch biopsy should be performed.HistopathologyHistologically, MAC can mimic infiltrative/morpheaform basal cell carcinoma, desmoplastic squamous cell carcinoma, desmoplastic trichoepithelioma, trichoadenoma, and syringoma.¬†Histopathological examination reveals small basaloid cells/keratocysts on the top, hence the term ‚Äúmicrocystic.‚Äù This is a key feature.¬†On higher power, one can see cords and strands of basaloid epitheloid cells displaying ductal lumina that invade the dermis and subdermis.¬†There is also fibrotic stroma. A key feature in distinguishing MAC from other tumors is a zone of separation between the epidermis and tumor. Additionally, the ductal structures distinguish MAC from desmoplastic trichoepithelioma and trichoadenoma.MAC is distinguished from morpheaform basal cell carcinoma and desmoplastic squamous cell carcinoma based on ductal differentiation.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is utilized in the pathologic evaluation of MAC to help support the diagnosis. In particular, the carcinoembryonic antigen stain (CEA) is positive in approximately 50% of MAC cases. This helps distinguish MAC from basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, where CEA is negative.
Stains
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is the standard stain used in the diagnosis of MAC.History and PhysicalMicrocystic adnexal carcinoma is a solitary white to pink plaque located on the face or trunk. In the case of early tumors, the appearance may be slightly elevated; however, a more nodular appearance tends to develop with time.EvaluationMAC often may be clinically indistinguishable from other skin-colored growths on the head and neck.¬†MAC may have perineural spread where patients can complain of numbness, tingling, pain, burning, and itching sensations. The key todiagnosis is taking an appropriate pathology specimen is needed, and the key to diagnosis. The tumor largely lies within the deep dermis. A superficial biopsy can lead to an incorrect diagnosis. If MAC is suspected, avoid a superficial shave biopsy.An incisional biopsy is recommended in the evaluation. However, punch biopsies and excisional biopsies are options in evaluation.
Full Skin Examination
If a biopsy results in a diagnosis of MAC, a full-body skin examination should take place.
Lymph Nodes
Lymph node examination should be performed to assess for regional metastases, albeit rare.Fine needle aspiration (FNA) or excisional biopsy of enlarged lymph nodes should be performed if detected on examination.
Imaging
Consider the need for imaging (CT or MRI) or fat-suppression MRI protocol for perineural invasion¬†or intraorbital tumors.[4]
Dermoscopy
Dermoscopy does not offer a definitive diagnosis of MAC. MAC is a rare tumor, so dermoscopic findings are limited to case reports with the most characteristic finding appears to be the presence of whitish clods of variable size. These whitish clods likely representing keratinous cyst.[5][6][7]¬†MAC¬†can appear¬†like a basal cell carcinoma due to the presence of arborizing vessels¬†reported in case literature.[8]Treatment / ManagementMAC is managed surgically by simple excision or Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). Complication rates between MMS¬†and simple excision¬†are similar. When utilizing MMS, clear margins were obtained in fewer procedures and resulted in fewer office visits.[9]In the event that Mohs micrographic surgery is not an option due to lack of procedure availability or tumor extent, intraoperative frozen sections may be useful for guiding conventional surgical excision.Patients should be followed every six to twelve months following diagnosis and management for full-body skin examination and lymph node examination.Differential DiagnosisMAC presents often on the face as a¬†papule or plaque. The differential can be large. However, the differential diagnosis where MAC must be distinguished from is morpheaform basal cell carcinoma, desmoplastic squamous cell carcinoma, desmoplastic trichoepithelioma, trichoadenoma, and syringoma.[3]Surgical OncologySentinel lymph node¬†biopsy (SLNB) is not recommended for the staging of MAC as per the current evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.[4]Evidence is lacking that¬†supports neck dissection for a positive lymph node at presentation.Node positive¬†and metastatic disease should be treated surgically¬†as per the local disease.[2]Radiation OncologyThe role of radiation therapy for microcystic adnexal carcinoma remains unclear. Monotherapy with radiotherapy is not recommended. According to the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for MAC, adjuvant radiotherapy can be considered for MAC when there is peripheral nerve involvement, when margins and unable to be cleared surgically, or when there is a tumor present at the margins. Although, there have been reports of chemoradiation with carboplatin/paclitaxel combination used in a patient refusing surgical management that remained tumor-free for six years.[10]Prophylactic radiotherapy of the sentinel node base is not supported by current evidence.[4]PrognosisThe major prognostic concern for MAC is the recurrence of the tumor. Recurrence is generally seen within two to three years; however, it may occur even decades later.[11]¬†MAC is a locally aggressive tumor whereas metastases are generally rare. Death may result from the invasion of vital structures.ComplicationsComplications of untreated tumors are locally aggressive invasion. Depending on location, complications can result from the invasion of vital structures. In some instances, death has resulted.Deterrence and Patient EducationPatients should be educated that MAC is a slow-growing tumor. Patients should be educated on the importance of follow-up examinations, and that recurrence may even occur¬†decades later in some instances.Pearls and Other IssuesMicrocystic adnexal carcinoma is a malignant tumor of sweat gland origin found primarily on the head and neck. An appropriate biopsy technique is key in establishing the correct diagnosis. Mohs micrographic surgery should be considered first-line surgical management in its ability to analyze the entire surgical margin intraoperatively.Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Microcystic adnexal carcinoma frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma.¬†These patients may note a long history of a papule or plaque on the head and neck. Physical examination of the skin may reveal tumor presence; however, accurate diagnosis depends on proper biopsy technique with a raised index of suspicion. While a dermatologist is almost always involved in the care of patients with microcystic adnexal carcinoma, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a Mohs surgeon, an otolaryngologist, and possibly a radiologist.¬†Nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group as they will assist with the education of the patient and family. In the postoperative period for pain and wound infection, the pharmacist will ensure the patient is on the right analgesics and antibiotics. The radiologist plays a vital role in determining the extent of involvement, perineural invasion, and presence of intraorbital tumors.¬†Clinical practice guidelines have been established in dermatology literature developed following an exhaustive review of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals to determine appropriate management based upon current evidence.[4]¬†[Level 1]Review Questions

IntroductionMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin with increasing incidence. It most frequently presents¬†on the head and neck region¬†of elderly, white males. Specific risk factors include ultraviolet (UV) exposure, advancing age, and immunosuppression, and its development is associated with Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) infection. [1][2][3]Skin biopsy is diagnostic, and sentinel lymph node evaluation should be performed in all patients who are diagnosed with MCC, as the disease typically has a rapidly progressive course. Treatment consists of wide local excision with or without adjuvant radiotherapy for local disease. New therapies for metastatic MCC have shown promise and include immune-based therapies.EtiologyThe cell of origin of MCC is debated and thought to be the epidermal or dermal stem cell rather than the differentiated Merkel cell. Studies have established the presence of MCPyV in the majority (80%) of MCC, suggesting its role as an etiologic agent in carcinogenesis.[4][5][6] MCPyV is an unenveloped double-stranded DNA virus of the family of polyomaviruses. Human infection with the virus is ubiquitous but asymptomatic, except in cases of MCC in which there is the clonal integration of the viral DNA into the host genome. UV exposure, advancing age, and immunosuppression are known risk factors for the development of MCC.EpidemiologyThe reported incidence rate has steadily increased over the last few decades with approximately 2000 new cases diagnosed per year, likely due to enhanced diagnostic techniques and a rise in the prevalence of known risk factors. Elderly males are most commonly affected, and over 90% of patients are Caucasian. The tumor has a predilection for sun-exposed sites, most frequently in the head and neck region.[7]PathophysiologyThe exact mechanism of carcinogenesis remains unclear. MCPyV infection is present in the majority of tumors, and several studies have demonstrated a causal relationship. Impaired immune surveillance, which may occur through factors such as aging, immunosuppressive medications, or AIDS, may facilitate the tumorigenicity of MCPyV. Integration of the virus into host DNA must be accompanied by specific mutations, which are thought to result from environmental mutagens, such as UV irradiation. These events contribute to the transformation of an asymptomatic viral infection into a tumorigenic infection. The remaining virus-negative tumors are thought to acquire multiple UV-signature mutations and have a much higher mutational burden than MCPyV-positive tumors.There are several documented and theorized immune evasion mechanisms in MCC, one of which is increased programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression that promotes cytotoxic T lymphocyte exhaustion. PD-L1 is a ligand for the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor expressed on T lymphocytes. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 limits T cell expansion and promotes functional exhaustion of T cells. Virus-positive and negative MCC can induce expression of PD-L1, which promotes local immune suppression and allows for immune evasion by the tumor.HistopathologyHistological examination reveals a dermal proliferation of small, blue cells in sheets or a trabecular array. The cells contain scant cytoplasm and round nuclei containing finely granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Numerous mitotic figures are typically visible, and the tumor may demonstrate vascular invasion, perineural invasion, or cellular necrosis. Immunohistochemistry differentiates MCC from other dermal, blue cell tumors such as lymphoma, Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, melanoma, and small cell lung cancer. An appropriate immunopanel should be performed and preferably include cytokeratin-20, a low-molecular-weight intermediate filament, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). MCC staining demonstrates positivity for cytokeratin-20 in a paranuclear dot pattern and is considered highly sensitive. Cells also demonstrate positivity for neuron-specific enolase, epithelial membrane antigen, CAM 5.2, and neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin and chromogranin. Importantly, cells are negative for TTF-1, S-100, and leukocyte-common antigen, which can help to distinguish MCC from the above-mentioned tumors.History and PhysicalMCC typically presents as a rapidly growing, asymptomatic, firm, red-violaceous nodule on sun-exposed skin, with the head and neck region most commonly involved. Occasionally, it can present as a subcutaneous nodule without overlying skin changes. The differential diagnosis may include basal cell carcinoma, amelanotic melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, epidermal inclusion cyst, or pyogenic granuloma. The tumor usually arises in the skin; however, it has also been described in several extracutaneous sites such as the salivary glands and nasal cavity. Because MCC follows an aggressive course, only 65% of patients present with local disease. Furthermore, it has been documented that MCC may arise in conjunction with other skin cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, or sebaceous carcinoma.EvaluationDefinitive diagnosis of MCC is made with a skin biopsy. In addition to a biopsy, a lymph node evaluation should be performed in all patients, regardless of stage.[8] Those with a clinically-positive node should undergo fine needle aspiration/core biopsy, and patients without clinically-positive nodes should undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). For patients with nodal disease, the additional workup should be performed that includes imaging, and PET/CT is the preferred imaging modality.Treatment / ManagementPrior to definitive treatment, all patients should undergo investigation to determine regional lymph node involvement as outlined above.[9][10][11]
Local Disease
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has published guidelines delineating specific treatment recommendations. Treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma consists of wide local excision of the primary tumor with 1-2 cm margins to investing fascia of muscle or pericranium when feasible. Mohs micrographic surgery may be considered provided it does not interfere with SLNB. Adjuvant radiation therapy to the primary tumor site may be beneficial and should be considered in specific cases; it may be appropriate for low-risk patients with a small primary tumor (less than 1 cm) and no other adverse risk factors (such as immunosuppression or lymphovascular invasion). The benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy to the SLNB-negative basin is unclear. In specific cases when there is a potential for a false-negative SLNB, then consideration of adjuvant radiotherapy is warranted, as well as in patients with profound immunosuppression. Particularly, in head and neck disease, the risk of false-negative SLNB is higher. Radiotherapy alone without excision should be reserved for patients who are poor surgical candidates.
Locoregional Disease
If the disease is limited to locoregional lymph nodes, a complete lymph node dissection should be performed and/or radiotherapy to the nodal basin. For patients with clinically evident adenopathy, lymph node dissection is the recommended initial therapy, followed by postoperative radiotherapy if certain NCCN indications are met. Those without clinically palpable nodes or nodal involvement noted on imaging, but with microscopic nodal disease noted on SLNB, should be treated with radiotherapy alone. Further, patients with more extensive disease who have multiple involved nodes and/or extracapsular extension noted with lymph node dissection should also undergo adjuvant radiotherapy. Importantly, in all cases, adjuvant therapy with radiation should not be delayed, because delay has been associated with worse outcomes.¬†
Metastatic Disease
Those with metastatic disease are best managed through a multidisciplinary tumor board.¬† NCCN guidelines recommend a clinical trial if available.¬† Alternatively, systemic therapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgery may be considered alone or in combination. Currently available systemic agents include cytotoxic chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Unfortunately, because of the aggressive nature of the disease, cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to provide patients with only three months of progression-free survival. However, immune-based therapies have demonstrated promising results in clinical trials. Specifically, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and avelumab are anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies that function to restore active T cell response against the tumor. One study showed a median progression-free survival of nine months with pembrolizumab therapy in patients with MCC.Furthermore, patients with a diagnosis of MCC should be followed every three to six months for three years and every six to 12 months thereafter, including complete skin and lymph node examinations.¬† Imaging studies may be routinely performed in high-risk patients and otherwise as clinically indicated.Differential DiagnosisBasal cell carcinomaCutaneous melanomaCutaneous squamous cell carcinomaDermatofibromaKeratoacanthomaThe dermatologic manifestation of metastatic carcinomasPrognosisMCC is a rare, aggressive skin cancer that often has local or distant metastatic spread at the time of diagnosis. Prognosis is poor and is dependent on the stage at presentation, with five-year overall survival estimates of 51%, 35%, and 14% being reported for local, nodal, and distant disease, respectively. Sentinel lymph node biopsy negativity is a strong predictor of longer disease-free survival and overall survival in stage I and II MCC patients. Further, patients with tumors less than 2 cm have a higher ten-year survival than those with tumors greater than 2 cm at presentation. Female sex, tumor size less than 2 cm, and location in the upper extremities are factors associated with increased survival.Pearls and Other IssuesPatients with a diagnosis of MCC require a multidisciplinary approach and require close follow-up with their dermatologist. Fortunately, clinical trials utilizing immunomodulating agents such as anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have shown great promise in providing improved progression-free survival.[12][13]Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes MCC is a very rare skin tumor that may present to the primary care provider, nurse practitioner or internist. These lesions may present as an aymptomatic growth or a painful lesion on the head and neck area. It is important to refer these patients to the dermatologist for definitive work up.¬†Patients with a diagnosis of MCC require an interprofessional approach that includes an oncologist, radiologist, surgeon and require close follow-up with their dermatologist. Todate, the prognosis for most patients is guarded; if the lesion is metastatic at the time of diagnosis, survival past 12 months is rare.¬†Fortunately, clinical trials utilizing immunomodulating agents such as anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have shown great promise in providing improved progression-free survival.[14][15]Review Questions

IntroductionThe lymphoid system is the pillar of the human immune response. It comprises innate immunity covered by NK cells and adaptive immunity by the B and T-cells. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a disorder of these immune cells. The understanding of these cells from their formation to maturation is necessary for the diagnosis and management of this disease spectrum.T-cell lymphomas consist of a wide variety of uncommon diseases that can be indolent or aggressive and comprise 12% of all NHL. Since NK-cells are closely related to the T-cells, their malignancies are also included in the classification. WHO released a revised lymphoma classification in 2016, which broadly divided T-cell/NK-cell lymphomas as the precursor and mature T-cell neoplasms. The mature subgroup is further divided into leukemic, nodal, extranodal, and cutaneous.[1]NHL can also be divided into indolent or aggressive diseases. Indolent lymphomas are characterized by a long disease course and are generally resistant to standard chemotherapy, whereas aggressive disease usually has an acute presentation with B symptoms and rapid progression. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is considered indolent, whereas peripheral mature lymphomas (PTCL), which include the rest, are considered aggressive. Two-thirds of the CTCLs¬†are comprised of mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sezary syndrome (SS). PTCL-NOS (not otherwise specified) is the most common among the PTCL, followed by anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL).[2]EtiologyThe cause of the majority of T-cell Lymphoma remains unexplained. CTCL is considered to arise secondary to the dysregulation of genes (cancer-testis genes and B lymphoid tyrosine kinase) and signaling pathways(Jak-3/STAT and NOTCH1). There have been reports suggesting an association between chronic cutaneous inflammation (eg, chronic urticaria, chemical exposure) and CTCL development.Infectious etiology has also been considered for both CTCL and PTCL, which include bacterial (staphylococcal enterotoxin) and viral association (retrovirus-like Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)1 and HTLV2, HIV, EBV, CMV, HHV8), with a specific association of HTLV1 with adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia and EBV with Natural-killer cell/T-cell lymphoma, and AITL.[3]¬†Enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma(ETAL) is seen in association with celiac disease. T-cell activating autoimmune disease and family history of myeloma increases the risk of T-cell lymphoma.[4]EpidemiologyThe incidence of T-cell lymphoma increases with advancing age. Geographic location and ethnic variability have an impact on the distribution of the disease. The usual age group of PTCL is between 55¬†to 74 years at the time of diagnosis, and it is more common in males. PTCL-NOS is more common in North America, whereas EBV-associated lymphomas are in Asia and Central and South America. ¬†Adult T-cell lymphoma is endemic to Japan and the Caribbean islands. ETAL is found to have an association with HLA DQ2 and DQ8, which in turn is related to celiac disease. ALK-positive ALCL and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma can be seen in younger people.[5] MF and SS have slightly greater incidences in the African-American population and are less common in Asia.[4]PathophysiologyThe lymphoid progenitors exit out of the thymus to form the T-cells. Their antigen detection is mediated through t-cell receptors (TCR).CTCL pathogenesis includes inhibition of apoptosis and promoting oncogenesis by targeting the tumor suppressor genes. Alteration of key signaling pathways, which include NOTCH overexpression, which helps in cell differentiation and proliferation, Fas underexpression, and dysregulation of JaK3/STAT by decreasing function and expression of negative regulators. The affinity of CTCL to the skin is thought to be mediated through the adhesion receptor mechanism. The cells migrate using the interaction between E selectin present in the endothelium and cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen(CLA) expressed in CTCL cells. These interactions are through chemokine receptors, the most common being CCR4, which is overexpressed here. CTCL has been shown to have distinct microRNA expression(miR-21 and miR155), which resists apoptosis and thus promotes proliferation.MF and SS mostly consist of helper memory or effector T-cells. They are usually positive for all T-cell markers. CD7 is expressed early in the differentiation process, but they are absent in T-cells homing to the skin, but marked deletion of CD7 is considered an ancillary confirmatory test. Malignant T-cells activate the T-cell receptor (TCR) pathway, which leads to the release of T-helper cell cytokines and persistent proliferation through alteration of Fas-mediated apoptosis and TGF beta related growth suppression.[4]PTCLs arise from post thymic T-cells/Natural killer (NK) cells, and the pathogenesis is poorly understood. Some studies of gene expression profiling have shown us that pathways altered are nuclear factor kappa B signaling and cell cycle deregulation, but those were underpowered studies. Most of them have a clonal expansion of TCR rearranged lymphocytes. This may not be seen in NK cell neoplasms. Some cytogenic aberrations seen in PTCL-NOS include gains in chromosome 7q and rearrangements of TP63, which results in oncogenic p63. Some other mechanisms include altering the microenvironment and remodeling the T-cell genome by viral molecules. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma(ALCL) is divided into two categories depending on the presence or absence of anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein(ALK). This distinction is necessary for clinical and prognostic assessment. Adult T-cell lymphoma, caused by HTLV-1, is spread through bodily fluids and causes clonal expansion and antiapoptosis of the CD4 cells by incorporating viral proteins that alter the signaling pathways, including but not limited to JAK-STAT and NFkB, thus leading to impaired cytokine production and host immunity.[6][7]HistopathologyHistologic features of CTCL are subtle and can mimic benign inflammation. Usual findings are haloed lymphocytes, exocytosis, epidermotropism, Pautrier microabscess, severely convoluted, and hyperchromatic lymphocytes in the epidermis and lymphocytes within the basal layer.[4]Bone marrow biopsy assists in diagnosis, ruling out other diseases, and prognostic assessment of PTCL. PTCL has diverse histological patterns and can have overlapping features of diseases like B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin disease. Adult T-cell lymphoma shows peripheral circulating lymphocytes with abnormally convoluted nuclei (feather nuclei, cloverleaf cell). ALCL is characterized by hallmark cells with horseshoe-shaped nuclei. Some common and universal findings include polymorphous infiltrates with the tumor cells, eosinophils, plasma cells, histiocytes, and blood vessels.[8]History and PhysicalThis disease spectrum usually presents late and in aggressive stages because the initial symptoms or signs almost always have benign conditions as the top differentials.CTCL, as their name suggests, presents as skin lesions. MF is usually restricted to the skin in the early stages, as macules and patches. But when the disease progresses, skin lesions become plaques, tumors, or nodules with associated adenopathy and other organ infiltration. Usually seen in the sun-protected area. But in the advanced stage, SS can arise de-novo or from MF, characterized by erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, and Sezary cells seen in peripheral blood, skin, and lymph nodes. SS is more aggressive, symptomatic, and with lower remission rates. Some of the precursor lesions associated with or that evolve into MF are clonal dermatitis/cutaneous lymphoid dyscrasias, follicular mucinosis,¬† lymphoid papulosis, pagetoid reticulosis, and granulomatous slack skin.[4]PTCL, as mentioned earlier, presents with nodal, extranodal, involving liver, spleen, leukemic, and cutaneous involvement. Extranodal is a common presentation. Sometimes, patients exhibit B symptoms(fever, night sweats, weight loss). Paraneoplastic syndromes associated with PTCL include eosinophilia, hemophagocytic syndrome, and autoimmune phenomena. AITL has associated underlying immune deficiency, leading to opportunistic infections. Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, which is very rare, can present as painless nodules or plaques, easily confused for an infectious/inflammatory process. Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is characterized by the involvement of the aero-digestive tract, especially the nasal region, leading to nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and bony destruction. Adult T-cell lymphoma can have cutaneous and extracutaneous manifestations, with the acute phase of the disease having hypercalcemia and lytic bone lesions. As its name suggests, hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma involves the bone marrow and is associated with marked hepatosplenomegaly.[2]EvaluationSince the clinical picture of CTCL has a significant overlap with benign conditions, it takes an average of almost 6 years to diagnose the disease from the onset.To diagnose, peripheral smear examination and bone marrow aspirate are necessary. Immunophenotyping and molecular cytogenetics to understand the clonality is important to assist in diagnosis and management. Combining the results from immunophenotyping, like cell lineage identification and aberrant antigen expression, with morphologic findings helps in diagnosis. If these results are inconclusive, molecular cytogenetics can be used to assess the clonality. Peripheral blood analysis for malignant T-cells is invaluable in the early stage of the disease. Lymph node or extranodal specimen biopsy findings augment the immunohistochemistry analysis and thus help in diagnosis.Malignant cells arise CD4+/CD8- in ATCL and AITL. In PTCL NOS cells are CD4/CD8. Detection of malignant T-cell clones provides a definite diagnosis through T-cell receptor (TCR) PCR and flow cytometry analysis. Cell surface marker also has diagnostic value in diagnosis. CD25+ in ARCL, pan T-cell antigen expression in AITL. EBV+ cells are found in AITL. ATCL ALK+ has t(2,5). Loss of CD26, CD27, CD7, and overexpression of CD 164 is commonly seen, later specifically in SS.[4] PCTCL-NOS shows the loss of almost all T-cell antigens, CD7, CD3, CD10, CD56+, and CD30 + expression. The progression of the disease is characterized by the expression of Ki67, CD34, and AgNORs. T-cell specific soluble IL-2 receptor is considered a marker of severity and to measure prognosis. Other markers used for the same include miRNA profiling, TOX gene, and EPHA4. ALCL has cells that are mostly CD30+.[2]Treatment / ManagementManagement starts with the correct identification of subtypes with a biopsy of the specific site for histopathological and immunophenotype analysis, calculation of the prognostic index, assessment of the extent of the disease by imaging, and the patient's performance status. If a specific subtype is suspected, testing for EBV PCR, HTLV-1 PCR, and celiac disease should be done.Computed tomography (CT) is used to assess and stage the disease as it is commonly available. FDG PET/CT scan is considered to have superior sensitivity because of the FDG avidity in some ¬†T-cell lymphomas and helps in staging and treatment response assessment. MRI is used particularly in soft tissue involvement in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma and subcutaneous panniculitis T-cell lymphoma.The treatment options available for CTCL are palliative, not curative. Therapy can be divided into skin directed for early-stage disease, systemic therapy for later-stage disease (advanced nodal or visceral disease), and disease refractory to localized treatments. Topical therapy includes UV A with psoralen (PUVA), UV B, external beam radiation, total skin radiation, topical chemotherapy, and topical retinoids. Systemic therapy is achieved by Interferon-alpha, oral retinoids, targeted therapies, single or combination chemotherapy, and stem cell transplant. Corticosteroids are also used as both targeted and systemic therapy.[4]Retinoids help through their antiproliferative and antiapoptotic properties. Commonly used topical regimens are bexarotene (FDA-approved) and tazarotene. Severe hyperlipidemia and central hypothyroidism are side effects of bexarotene. Systemic retinoids include acitretin, isotretinoin, and bexarotene. Topical chemotherapy commonly used are mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard), an alkylating agent, and carmustine. Systemic chemotherapy commonly used is methotrexate, pralatrexate, chlorambucil, gemcitabine, pegylated doxorubicin, and antimetabolite like fludarabine phosphate, 2-deoxycoformycin. PUVA inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis, but it will affect both normal and neoplastic cells; thus, the side effect profile is secondary malignancies of the skin. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are the newer group of therapeutic options available for the treatment of CTCL, which have both transcription-dependent and independent mechanisms of action for the expression of tumor suppressor genes. Vorinostat and romidepsin are FDA-approved, with an overall response rate of almost 50% with a tolerable side effect profile, the prominent one being cardiac arrhythmias from QTc prolongation. Targeted therapies include imiquimod (Toll-like receptor agonist), denileukin diftitox (recombinant fusion protein), alemtuzumab (a monoclonal antibody against CD52), and everolimus ( mTOR pathway target). Agents that are still undertrial are proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib. Allogenic stem cell transplant is used in advanced stages, usually appropriate for young patients with relapsing disease.[9]Because of the rarity of the disease and the lack of randomized trials, there are no optimal treatment options for PTCL, but it is dependent on the small trials. Standard chemotherapy is CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, prednisone) or a CHOP-like regimen( addition of etoposide). Etoposide based regimens are CHOEP and EPOCH. These are better tolerated by younger patients and people with higher performance status. Other chemotherapy regimens that have been tried include ACVBP(dose-intensified doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, prednisone) plus consolidation with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone). Other treatment modalities have been made by improving CHOP by adding newly approved/under trial medications. These include the addition of anti-CD-52 antibody (alemtuzumab) and denileukin diftitox (fusion protein between IL-2 and diphtheria toxin) to the CHOP/CHOP-like regimen; both are in phase II and had a significant side effect profile.[9]Treatment regimens now under phase III are ¬†Brentuximab Vedotin (anti CD30 monoclonal antibody)[10]¬†and CHP vs. CHOP, ¬†Romidepsin (HDAC inhibitor) CHOP (Ro-CHOP) Versus CHOP, these two for induction and Pralatrexate Versus Observation Following CHOP-based Chemotherapy for maintenance. In ALCL, CD 30 expression is assessed; if positive, the treatment regimen brentuximab vedotin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (BV +CHP), is considered superior to CHOP.ALK positivity in ALCL also plays an important role as ALK inhibitors(Crizotinib, Alectinib). Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is generally refractory to CHOP regimens because of the presence of the P-glycoprotein gene. For localized variants, chemoradiotherapy using dexamethasone, carboplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide, whereas for advanced disease, L-asparaginase with ifosfamide, etoposide, dexamethasone, and methotrexate (SMILE). Adult T-cell lymphoma-leukemia has a very poor prognosis. Because of the rapid progression of the disease, the most appropriate treatment modality is unclear, and the patient should be enrolled in a clinical trial. The current treatment modality is VCAP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone), AMP (doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisone), VECP (vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, prednisone), and intrathecal chemotherapy with the addition of anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab.[11]For those who are more than 70 years old, CHOP is used. Interferon-alpha plus zidovudine for HTLV1 has proven effective in acute, chronic, and smoldering ATL, not in the lymphoma stage. ALCL Stem cell transplant is considered in the consolidation phase after achieving first remission, complete or partial. Transplant in second or third remission is less studied. In the case of ALCL with a low prognostic score, we should hold off on the stem cell transplant because of their good response to chemotherapy.[11]Relapsed or refractory PTCL is managed with ASCT if the patient is a candidate for the same. No chemotherapy has been proven superior over the other. The decision should be made about transplants before starting the treatment. Multiagent chemotherapy includes ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide or dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatinum, which induces remission but cannot be continued for long because of the side effect profile and is thus useful pre-transplant. If the patient is transplant-ineligible, chemotherapy regimens like romidepsin and pralatrexate are more tolerable.Differential DiagnosisThe common differentials for CTCL are erythroderma like atopic/contact dermatitis, drug eruptions, erythrodermic psoriasis, lichen planus, cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis t-cell lymphoma.[4]PTCL differentials include other subtypes of T-cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma, granulomatous histiocytosis, and paracortical hyperplasia.Radiation OncologyRadiation is very effective in the treatment of CTCL since these lymphocytes are sensitive to radiation therapy. External beam radiation is used in stages I to III and whole-body skin electron beam for advanced disease.Radiation in setting on PTCL is given in cases of a limited-stage disease, early and upfront in the consolidation phase, and palliation to alleviate the symptoms. 17919841. In cases of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, radiation therapy as a primary treatment, especially in the indolent phase, has been found to have a favorable prognosis.[12]StagingLugano classification is a staging system used for all types of¬†lymphomas. It is divided into limited vs. advanced.[13]
Limited
I:¬†Involvement:¬†One node or a group of adjacent nodes.¬†¬†Extranodal status:¬†Single extranodal lesions without nodal involvement.II: Involvement: Two or more nodal groups on the same side of the diaphragm. Extranodal status: Stage I or II by nodal extent with limited contiguous extranodal involvement.
Advanced
III:¬†Involvement: Nodes on both sides of the diaphragm; nodes above the diaphragm with spleen involvement.IV:¬†Involvement:¬†Additional noncontiguous extra lymphatic involvement.PrognosisCTCL, at initial stages, has the same life expectancy as healthier adults. But when the disease progresses to more infiltrative and visceral involvement, it has bad prognostic effects. MF is a lifelong disease and recurs after stopping the treatment. Many patients who have a chronic course die from an unrelated disease. SS has a poor prognosis, with median survival between 3-4 years.[4]PTCL has a poor prognosis compared to its B-cell counterpart. The international prognostic index, which has age, performance status, LDH, stage, and extranodal involvement, helps in determining the prognosis. Even if the IPI index is low, it is still considered to have a poorer prognosis. The presence of some markers, including p53, Ki-67, BCL-2, BCl-X, CD 26, and EBV, denotes poor prognosis, whereas AKL, NFkB, CCR3, and TCR BF1 presence shows good prognosis.[6]ComplicationsThe patients are at high risk of infection due to altered immune systems and high rates of secondary cancers, especially lymphomas. Hypercalcemia and lytic bone lesions are involved in acute T-cell lymphoma/leukemia. Bony destruction is also seen in Extranodal Nk/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. Visceral involvement of skin, GI tract, lungs, and adrenals are seen. Large cell transformation, which means more aggressive transformation, is seen in CTCL. Precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma can cause superior vena cava syndrome, tracheal obstruction, and pleural/pericardial effusion. Ulceration of the lesion can be seen in MF.[6]ConsultationsA team approach is necessary for the diagnosis and management of the various T-cell lymphomas. While the microscopic diagnosis is established by the hematopathologist, the medical oncology should know when to discuss the patient's treatment options with a radiation oncologist. A multidisciplinary conference with the surgeon, medical, and radiation oncologist will help in deciding the appropriate management options for these patients.Deterrence and Patient EducationPatients should be educated about the etiology, disease course, and prognosis. Reversible factors that have been studied are chronic chemical exposure/pesticides and HTLV-1 infection, which is transmissible. They should be advised to stop the exposure to the chemicals, be careful in handling bodily fluids, and have safe sex practices.Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Since it is a rare spectrum of disease,¬† an interprofessional approach is needed, including the medical and radiation oncologist and hematopathologist. We should be familiar with the common subtypes seen in the respective endemic areas. Because the initial presentation can be very subtle, the treatment team should suspect this disease after ruling out the top differential diagnosis.Review Questions

IntroductionPeripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a heterogeneous¬†group of lymphomas¬†accounting for 5% to 15% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), in the western world. It is comprised of peripheral (systemic) and cutaneous forms developed from T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Clinically, these lymphomas¬†are often aggressive.[1][2][3]Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) is nowadays considered a separate subtype of PTCL. This form, described in 1974 by Frizzera et al., was previously known by several synonyms such as 'angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia', 'immunoblastic lymphadenopathy', and 'lymphogranulomatosis X'.[4] The follicular T helper cell, based on molecular analyses, is considered the cell of origin for AITL.[4][5][6][1]Cutaneous lymphomas are NHLs manifesting in the skin in the absence of extracutaneous manifestations at the time of diagnosis. Further subdivided into cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL) and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), CTCLs comprise up to four-fifths of all primary cutaneous lymphomas. Of note, CTCLs¬†are classified separately from the group of PTCLs.Among the CTCLs there are Mycosis fungoides (MF), Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and Sezary syndrome (SS). MF also termed 'Alibert-Bazin syndrome' or 'granuloma fungoides', represents the most common type of CTCL while remaining a rare type of NHL. Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma is another form of CTCL. Both contribute to roughly four-fifths of all CTCLs.Large Cell Cutaneous Ki-1 Anaplastic Lymphoma also termed as 'Anaplastic large cell lymphoma' (ALCL) or 'CD30 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma' is a rare¬†and aggressive type of PTCL (NHL). This form is encompassed among the group of CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorders and can affect lymph nodes and extranodal sites. Usually, based on the expression of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein, two sub-types are described: ALK-positive and ALK-negative Large Cell Cutaneous Ki-1 Anaplastic Lymphoma.SS is a rare leukemic form of CTCL. It is historically identified as a triad of pruritic erythroderma, generalized lymphadenopathy, and the presence of distinct ‚ÄúSezary cells‚Äù in the skin, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood. Although MF is a primary subtype of CTCL, it has historically and inappropriately been used interchangeably with CTCL.[7][8]¬†It¬†is an aggressive form of¬†CTCL.This chapter will address:Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphomaLarge Cell Cutaneous Ki-1 Anaplastic LymphomaCutaneous T-cell lymphoma:
Mycosis fungoidesSezary syndrome
EtiologyA¬†pooled analysis¬†from¬†15¬†case-control studies¬†identified the following risk¬†factors as associated with a high overall statistically significant¬†risk of developing PTCL, including a family history of¬†hematologic malignancies, eczema, psoriasis, celiac disease, heavy smoking, certain occupations (textile worker, electrical fitter).[9]¬†The etiology of the Large Cell Cutaneous Ki-1 Anaplastic Lymphoma is unknown. Molecular investigation proved that in the ALK-positive sub-type, the tyrosine kinase receptor ALK gene (2p23) is overexpressed due to a t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation.[10]The etiological picture of MS and SS is uncertain. Environmental factors, immunological alterations, infections, and other tumors are possible factors that could favor the onset of CTCLs. Considering that subjects affected by these pathologies have a familial predisposition to tumors, it seems that genetic factors are more involved in the onset of¬†MF and SS than other lymphomas.EpidemiologyAITL comprises up to¬†2% of all NHL cases; however, it represents one out of every five PTCL cases per annum. After PTCL not otherwise specified (NOS), it is considered the most common PTCL subtype. It carries a 1:1 male to female ratio, is more common in Europe than in Asia or North America, and has a median age of 65-70 yrs. in the United States (US) and worldwide.[3][11][12]¬†Retrospective studies showed that the incidence of CTCL increased steadily between 1973 and 1998 and has stabilized since then. Moreover, CTCL incidence is twice in males compared to females. It is common in African Americans, metropolitan areas, and patients with higher income and education levels. Increased incidence was observed in patients following organ transplants and those with HIV.[13][14][15][16]MF, the commonest CTCL subtype, comprise about 50% of all CTCLs. The incidence rate is almost twice as common in males with a median age at diagnosis between 55 and 60. Hispanic patients were observed to present at younger ages, higher stage, and aggressive clinical course. Sezary syndrome represents about 3-5% of all CTCLs and is more common in non-Hispanic whites.[17][18][19][20][21]¬†Large cell cutaneous Ki-1 anaplastic lymphoma represents about 25% to 30% of all CTCLs and is the second most common subtype after MF. It is seen most among non-Hispanic whites and has an excellent prognosis. It can occur at any age with a peak incidence in the 60s.[14][22][23]History and PhysicalCommon clinical features of AITL includes B-symptoms (drenching night sweats, fever, weight loss) and lymphadenopathy. Enlargement of the liver and spleen may be present at diagnosis. Rashes may be the antecedent finding in about 20% to 50% of AITL patients, with skin manifestations ranging from urticarial lesions to nodular tumors.[24][25][26]Patients with CTCLs often present with ‚Äúchronic dermatitis,‚Äù that is resistant to therapy and often misdiagnosed as chronic nonspecific dermatoses. The lesions of MF may progress from ‚Äúpatch‚Äù to ‚Äúplaque‚Äù to ‚Äútumor.‚Äù A patch is a flat lesion with varying degrees of erythroderma, and plaque is a raised, well-demarcated lesion less than a cm in size. In contrast, the tumor is defined as a raised lesion greater than a centimeter. The clinical-stage determines the distribution of lesions with early-stage having a predilection for folds and non-exposed sun areas.Lesions are usually pruritic, with severity known for determining the quality of life in these patients. Sezary syndrome, the aggressive leukemic form of CTCLs, is characterized by pruritic erythroderma, generalized lymphadenopathy, and circulating leukemic ‚ÄúSezary cells‚Äù in the peripheral blood. PCALCL usually presents as a brownish to violaceous nodule or tumor and may be solitary to generalized in distribution.[27][28]Evaluation
Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma
Initial evaluation, in addition to physical examination, should include complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, LDH, HTLV-1, systemic imaging such as CT chest, abdomen, pelvis with contrast, or positron emission tomographic [PET-CT] scan, bone marrow evaluation, echocardiogram (before anthracycline therapy).[1]¬†Diagnosis is based on clinical features, histopathologic features, immunophenotyping, and molecular studies.¬†
Hematology
Some of the hematological abnormalities include polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, direct coombs positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia, peripheral eosinophilia.[12]¬†
Histopathology
The cell of origin of AITL is the follicular T helper cell. There is dysregulation of T helper cells resulting in unchecked B cell activation and development of AITL. It is histologically characterized by effacement of normal lymphoid architecture, accompanied by a pleomorphic cellular infiltrate, resulting in loss of follicles and extensive intranodal revascularization. The cellular infiltrate includes B cells, plasma cells, histiocytes, eosinophils. Some of the B cells are EBV+ reflecting the immunodeficient state.[12][6][29]
Immunophenotyping and molecular studies
Immunophenotyping reveals that the malignant cells are CD3+, CD4+, and CD10+. CXCL13, uniformly expressed in neoplastic cells, is diagnostically significant, whereas CD30+, which is seen in about 20% of all AITLs, is therapeutically relevant.[30][31][32]An abnormal karyotype is seen in AITL and frequently involves chromosomes 3 and 5. Clonal complexity is considered a negative prognostic factor.[33][34]¬†A diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma may be uncovered concomitantly at the time of diagnosis of AITL or at relapse, warranting the need for re-biopsy if a relapse is suspected.¬†
Large Cell Cutaneous Ki-1 Anaplastic Lymphoma
The diagnosis depends on clinical and histopathological findings. Histopathology usually reveals large cells, with about 75% expressing CD30. Immunophenotyping reveals that mostly these cells are CD4+ with loss of pan-T markers such as CD2, CD3, and CD 5. In contrast to systemic ALCL, the cells in PCALCL are usually negative for CD15 and epithelial membrane antigen.[35]
Mycosis fungoides and Sezary Syndrome
Diagnosis is usually based on clinical and histopathologic findings. Once a diagnosis is made, accurate staging is essential as it provides prognostic significance. Initial workup includes biopsy of the skin and/or lymph nodes, bone marrow biopsy (if cytopenia or extracutaneous disease is suspected), flow cytometry, and systemic imaging. The purpose of flow cytometry is to assess the clonality of T-cells.¬†Histopathology: The classic MF skin lesion appears as a superficial lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate. The lymphocytes range from small to large and characteristically reveal cerebriform nuclei. The hallmark of this malignant infiltrate is epidermotropism (lymphocytes frequent the epidermis without any obvious spongiosis) and clusters of lymphocytes around the Langerhans cell in the epidermis, what is known as the Pautrier microabscesses. In the advanced stages, there is a lack of epidermotropism, and the lymphocytes are characteristically large, atypical, and extend deeper into the dermis.[36]Immunophenotyping plays a vital role in diagnosis, with cells expressing CD3+CD4+CD45RO+CD8-. Loss of maturation markers on the CD4+ cell, such as CD7 and CD26, indicates malignant clonality of the T-lymphocyte.[37]Treatment / Management
Angioimmunoblastic T cell Lymphoma¬†

General¬†approach:
Despite the seemingly disappointing failure-free survival rates, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) therapy is the most employed backbone in the upfront setting based on data from three large retrospective studies. CHOP for six cycles every three weeks is considered the standard therapy for patients newly diagnosed with AITL over the age of 60. A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial comparing brentuximab vedotin plus CHP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, prednisone) versus CHOP for CD30+ peripheral T-cell lymphomas, revealed significantly better progression-free survival and overall survival with the former. CHOP with etoposide (CHOEP) was seen to improve event-free survival in a cohort consisting of AITL patients, but this was statistically insignificant. CHOEP may provide the ability to achieve deeper remission, which would ensure that the patient receives a transplant. Nonrandomized data supports the use of High dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in the upfront setting.[1][12][38][39][40][41]
Treatment of relapsed/refractory AITL¬†
Management of relapsed/refractory (primary progressive) AITL is currently evolving. If patients are eligible for transplant and have not received it during initial treatment, divergent treatment patterns have evolved. These include short course combination regimens borrowed from relapsed, aggressive B-cell lymphomas such as ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) and DHAP (dexamethasone, cisplatin, cytarabine) with an overall response rate (ORR) of up to 70%, and the other is continuous therapy which includes the Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors such as romidepsin and belinostat. The overall response rate to romidepsin was 30%, whereas belinostat had an ORR of 45% in AITL. For patients who are ‚Äútransplant-ineligible‚Äù with relapsed/refractory AITL, median OS is 5.5 months, and continuous therapy, as mentioned above, are options.[12]¬†
Large Cell Cutaneous Ki-1 Anaplastic Lymphoma
Anthracycline-based chemotherapy, such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) or CHOP-like regimen, is the treatment of the first choice. This approach can be combined with radiotherapy in stage I/II disease. Pediatric patients follow different protocols, similar to those used for B-cell lymphomas, and in combination with other drugs such as methotrexate, etoposide, and cytarabine. Also, high-dose chemotherapy, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, may be offered, usually in the case of relapses or as a first-choice treatment in the case of a poor prognosis. Conjugated antibodies (brentuximab vedotin) may be given when at least one chemotherapy protocol has proved ineffective.
Mycosis fungoides and Sezary Syndrome
Management of MF¬†and SS is heavily reliant on the accurate staging of this condition. Staging of MF¬†and SS is essential for choosing therapy and for prognostication. It is unique as it incorporates atypical circulating cells in the blood (B) and tumor, nodes, and metastases (TNMB classification).
Staging
Tumor or ‚ÄúT‚Äù is further classified into four types and classified based on the appearance of skin lesions. T1 means limited patches/papules/plaques involving less than 10% skin area, T2 describes generalized patches/papules/plaques involving greater than 10% of skin area, T3 is any tumor greater than or equal to 1 cm in size, and T4 is generalized erythroderma over at least 80% of surface area. Nodes (N) are classified based on clinical examination and histopathological grade of lymph nodes (LN). N0 means no clinically abnormal appearing LN. N1 is abnormal appearing lymph node in addition to histopathological Dutch grade 1 or NCI grade 0 to 2, N2 is abnormal LN in addition to Dutch grade 2/NCI grade 3, and N3 is abnormal LN in addition to Dutch grade 3 to 4/NCI grade 4. Metastases or ‚ÄúM‚Äù are classified based on visceral involvement, with M0, which means no visceral involvement and M1, which implies visceral organ involvement. Blood or ‚ÄúB‚Äù is subdivided into B0, B1, and B2. B0 is circulating atypical cells (Sezary cells) less than 5%, B1 is defined as Sezary cells greater than 5%. B2 is defined as Sezary cells greater than 1000 cells/mm3, CD4/CD8 ratio higher than 10, and evidence of a T cell clone.[42]Based on the revised staging by ISCL/EORTC in 2007, blood involvement (B) is incorporated into the clinical staging. Stage I is determined mainly by skin involvement (T) and is divided into IA (T1 N0 M0 B0/1) and IB (T2 N0 M0 B0/1). Stage II is determined mainly by skin involvement (T) and nodal involvement; it is subdivided into IIA (T1/2 N1/2 M0 B0/1) and IIB (T3 N1/2 M0 B0/1). Stage III is characterized by erythroderma (T4) and is subdivided into IIIA (T4 N0-2 M0 B0) and IIIB (T4 No-2 M0 B1). Stage IV is determined by blood involvement and metastases; it is subdivided into IVA1 (T1-4 N0-2 M0 B2), IVA2 (T1-4 N3 M0 B0-2), and IVB (T1-4 N0-3 M1 B0-2).[42]
Treatment approach
Treatment approaches for MF and SS involve local and systemic therapy. Local therapy or skin-directed therapy includes topical glucocorticoids, topical nitrogen mustard, topical tacrolimus, topical carmustine, topical retinoids, imiquimod, phototherapy, photodynamic therapy, and electron beam therapy. Options for systemic therapy includes oral retinoids, histone deacetylase inhibitors (vorinostat, romidepsin), interferon-alpha, extracorporeal photopheresis, monoclonal antibodies (anti CD52, alemtuzumab), monoclonal antibody conjugate (anti CD30 therapy, brentuximab vedotin), chemotherapy.
Local therapy
The general treatment philosophy is that skin-directed therapy is used in early stages (IA and IB) or combination with systemic agents in advanced disease. Topical glucocorticoids are rarely used as monotherapy, and they have the disadvantage of causing skin atrophy. Topical carmustine, tacrolimus, and nitrogen mustard are used infrequently. Phototherapy utilizes ultraviolet radiation (UVA and UVB) and is considered an effective treatment for early-stage (IA and IB) MF and SS. However, it has not been FDA-approved due to a lack of prospective trials. Photodynamic therapy is a form of photochemotherapy utilizing porphyrin induced selective, localized production of cytotoxic oxygen species at the tumor site. Electron beam therapy is localized radiation therapy using electron beams and is known to have a complete remission of up to 80 percent.[43][44][45][46][47][48][49]
Systemic therapy
Systemic agents are used for advanced disease (stage III/IV) and maybe also be used in persistent/relapsed stage I disease. Oral bexarotene is a retinoid used as a first-line systemic agent in MF, with an overall response rate of 45 to 57 percent. It has many adverse effects such as hypertriglyceridemia and central hypothyroidism and should never be used in pregnancy or anticipated pregnancy due to its teratogenic effects. Histone deacetylase inhibitors such as romidepsin and interferon-alpha have been used as monotherapy or combination therapy with other systemic options.[50][46][51][52][53] As monotherapy, their overall response rate ranges between 35 to 50 percent. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) involves the administration of Psoralens, which is a photoactive compound followed by UVA radiation, also known as PUVA. Retrospective reviews have revealed improved survival advantage with ECP.Alemtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody of CD52, depletes leukemic cells and is highly effective in SS. Brentuximab vedotin, a monoclonal antibody conjugate of CD30, recently showed an overall response rate of 54 percent in MF. Chemotherapy options include alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil), Antimetabolites (pralatrexate), and anthracyclines (doxorubicin). Treatment with single-agent chemotherapy resulted in a higher incidence of large cell transformation associated with a poor prognosis than the original diagnosis. Combined multimodality therapy was associated with much better outcomes.[54][55][56][57][58][59]Differential Diagnosis
Angioimmunoblastic T Cell Lymphoma
Given the presentation of type B symptoms, rash, lymphadenopathy, differential diagnoses include cutaneous lymphoid neoplasms (including cutaneous lymphomas), infections, an autoimmune disease. The pathological examination of suspicious lesions clinches the diagnosis.¬†
Large Cell Cutaneous Ki-1 Anaplastic Lymphoma
Differential diagnosis includes Hodgkin's lymphoma and T-cell lymphomas, in which CD30 can be expressed.
Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma
Benign dermatoses seem to be the most prominent differential diagnoses for cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. These conditions include psoriasis, contact dermatitis, drug eruption. Several of these benign dermatoses may even have T-cell rearrangements (TCR).Staging
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma
They are classified according to Lugano classification for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Divided into four stages: Stage I is¬†a single¬†lymph node region or one extra lymphatic region or site. Stage II is two lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm or with localized involvement of an extra lymphatic organ. Stage III refers to lymph node involvement on both sides of the diaphragm. Stage 4 refers to the widespread involvement of one or more extra lymphatic organs (lung, bone marrow).[60]
Cutaneous T Cell Lymphomas
Staging has been discussed above under the management section.Prognosis
Angioimmunoblastic T Cell Lymphoma
Up to 4 prognostic scoring systems are currently in use for AITL. These include IPI (International prognosis index), mPIT (Modified prognostic index for PTCL), IPTCLP (International peripheral T cell lymphoma project score). The use of Age and performance status as markers is consistent among these scoring systems mentioned above. IPTCLP uses platelet count in addition to above, whereas mPIT uses Ki-67%.[61]
Large Cell Cutaneous Ki-1 Anaplastic Lymphoma
When treated, ALK-positive patients (5-year survival of 70-80%) have a better prognosis than ALK-negative patients (5-year survival of 33% to 49%). Relapses worsen the prognosis.
Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary Syndrome
Prognosis largely depends on the stage of the disease. Transformation to large T-cell lymphoma (CD30+ or CD30-) carries unfavorable prognosis.[62][63]ComplicationsThe commonest cause of death is an infection in both AITL and CTCLs. It contributes to roughly half of the death in these patients. Septicemia and bacterial pneumonia are the most common etiology. About 10% with advanced MF develop herpes virus infection. After infection, widespread visceral involvement seems to be the most frequent cause of death.ConsultationsPeripheral T cell lymphomas are relatively rare hematologic malignancies and need interdisciplinary involvement. This team should comprise a hematologist specializing in lymphomas, hematopathologist, oncologist, primary care physician, oncology nurse, oncological pharmacist, Infectious disease expert, Social worker. Depending on the type of peripheral T cell lymphoma (cutaneous or AITL), this team can also include a dermatologist, radiation oncologist, and palliative medicine specialist.Deterrence and Patient EducationPatients should be educated about the type of cancer, its prognosis, treatment options, and possible treatment side effects before beginning therapy.Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes There is no cure for AITL outside the realm of bone marrow transplantation. Early involvement of a hematologist specializing in malignant hematology to choose an ideal chemotherapy regimen to induce remission (either complete or partial remission) in the ‚Äútransplant eligible‚Äù patient is important. In patients who are ‚Äútransplant-ineligible,‚Äù the strategy should be to choose an ideal regimen to increase progression-free survival. A dermatologist, radiation oncologist, and hematologist should evaluate patients with cutaneous T cell lymphomas (MF and PCALCL) to choose an ideal therapeutic regimen that involves a combination of skin directed therapy and systemic therapy or one of them.A clean line of communication needs to be maintained between these key players mentioned above to provide optimal care to these patients. Treatment of Peripheral T cell lymphomas can result in a lot of drug toxicity; these should be monitored with frequent follow-ups, especially during active chemotherapy.Review Questions

Abstract:
Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma are two aggressive skin malignancies with high disease-related mortality and increasing incidence rates. Currently, invasive tumor tissue biopsy is the gold standard for their diagnosis, and no reliable easily accessible biomarker is available to monitor patients with melanoma or Merkel cell carcinoma during the disease course. In these last years, liquid biopsy has emerged as a candidate approach to overcome this limit and to identify biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic response prediction, and patient follow-up. Liquid biopsy is a blood-based non-invasive procedure that allows the sequential analysis of circulating tumor cells, circulating cell-free and tumor DNA, and extracellular vesicles. These innovative biosources show similar features as the primary tumor from where they originated and represent an alternative to invasive solid tumor biopsy. In this review, the biology and technical challenges linked to the detection and analysis of the different circulating candidate biomarkers for melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma are discussed as well as their clinical relevance. 


Keywords: cancer; skin cancers; liquid biopsy; biomarkers; melanoma; merkel cell carcinoma












  1. IntroductionThis review discusses the most recent data on liquid biopsy in patients with melanoma, the most common skin cancer with high prevalence in US and European populations [1], or Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC), a skin tumor with a disease-associated mortality rate even higher than that of melanoma [2]. Due to their high mortality rate, new technologies are needed to improve the patient outcome. Particularly, specific biomarkers are required to facilitate their diagnosis and management. For a long time, cancer study was based on the analysis of specimens from the primary tumor or its metastases and on imaging data. The current limitations of tumor tissue biopsies and clinical imaging for cancer diagnosis and molecular profiling have led to the development of liquid biopsy. Indeed, tumor biopsy is an invasive procedure, and tumor tissue (especially in patients with cutaneous melanoma) is not always available. Therefore, liquid biopsy, a blood-based analysis of tumor-specific biomarkers, has been introduced as a new diagnostic approach that relies on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and on circulating tumor-derived factors, such as cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNAs (miRNA) and exosomes. The ultimate goal of liquid biopsy is to use the information gathered from such cells and factors to predict early cancer progression and to longitudinally monitor the treatment response, for a personalized medicine of patients with cancer. In melanoma, liquid biopsy has been already used to study many biomarkers (e.g., CTCs, ctDNA and exosomes), and its clinical pertinence is currently investigated in various clinical trials. For MCC, studies are in the early days and very few articles have been published. Moreover, no clinical trial is assessing liquid biopsy in MCC. In this review, we describe the circulating biomarkers and discuss the technical challenges and the clinical relevance of liquid biopsy for these two skin malignancies.  2. MelanomaMelanoma represents only 10% of all skin malignancies, but is one of the most aggressive cancers, responsible for approximately 80% of all skin cancer-related deaths [3]. Risk factors are well known and include acute sun exposure during childhood, teenage and early adulthood, genetic background, skin pigmentation features and number of naevi [4]. Its incidence is steadily increasing in most western countries. Melanoma can be surgically cured if detected at early stages, but survival rates are drastically reduced when discovered at advanced stages. The main issue for melanoma management is the huge heterogeneity of molecular changes that can occur during the disease course. Liquid biopsy might represent a valuable tool especially in high-risk patients with advanced stage melanoma (IIc, III and IV) because currently, no melanoma-specific blood-based biomarker test is available. Biomarkers could be used to provide ‚Äúreal-time‚Äù snapshots of the cancer before, during and after specific treatments. Different groups have been working on strategies to monitor melanoma course and therapy responses by measuring circulating markers, such as CTCs, ctDNA and miRNA [5]. Here, we will review the most recent advances.   2.1. Circulating Tumor CellsOriginally, liquid biopsy was developed to study CTCs [6]. CTCs are cancer cells that are released by the primary tumor and/or metastases in the circulation. Due to cancer cell short half-life, CTC detection, count and characterization offer real-time data on the cancer status. Moreover, they can bring insights into the heterogeneity of the melanoma cell population. The detection of Circulating Melanoma Cells (CMCs) was described for the first time in 1991. Since then, the many studies on CMCs from patients with melanoma at different stages and using different detection approaches have given conflicting results [7].  2.1.1. BiologyMelanoma cells do not express epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), the classical epithelial cell surface marker that is at the basis of most CTC isolation strategies [8]. Therefore, alternative approaches based on the large size of primary melanoma cells have been developed to isolate CMCs by filtration, and several melanoma-specific cell surface epitopes have been tested for CTC enrichment [9]. Indeed, as metastatic melanoma is a highly heterogeneous tumor, CMCs may display different phenotypes and functional states. For example, nestin, CD133 [10], receptor activator of NF-kB (RANK) [11], ABCB5 [12], CD20 [13] and CD271 [14] have been proposed as potential candidates for the identification of melanoma-initiating cells. However, the diversity of markers limits the possibility to compare studies and reduces the significance of the obtained results.Melanoma is one of the malignancies which present the highest mutation landscape, mainly caused by carcinogenic ultraviolet (UV) light exposure and other mutational process. The most common genomic alterations studied in melanoma are BRAF, NRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, NF1, KIT, RAC1 and TERT [15,16]. Despite the lack of clear clinical relevance of most mutations, some exceptions exist, for example, BRAF V600 mutations clearly predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF and MEK [15]. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that the mutational heterogeneity of melanoma cells might influence their volume and the expression of surface markers. For example, activation of the RAS/RAF pathway drives the expression of HMW-MAA, commonly used as a surface marker for CMC enrichment [17,18]. Georges et al. also reported that the RAS/RAF-mutated cohort present a larger proportion of surface marker-positive cells (e.g., CSPG4/MCAM) compared to the non-RAF/RAS mutated cohort and concluded that the positive enrichment method based on surface markers could be biased by the mutational status of the cells which lead to the loss of subsets of CTCs [19]. On the other hand, treatment with BRAF inhibitors decreases the volume of enlarged BRAF-mutated melanoma cells in a glucose-dependent manner [20]. CTC analysis showed not only their genomic heterogeneity and phenotypic diversity, but also their ability to form clusters and to escape the immune system [21]. Indeed, CMCs can be detected as circulating clusters [22]. Studies in other cancer types demonstrated that in clusters, CTCs display a higher metastatic potential with longer survival and reduced apoptosis following dissemination despite a faster clearance [23,24]. Concerning the immune system escape, it is well known that programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive cancer cells are not detected and destroyed by immune cells because its expression hinders their recognition as tumor cells [25]. This observation led to the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors, antibodies against PD-L1 and its receptor PD-1, with a remarkable clinical response in different malignancies, particularly in melanoma.  2.1.2. Technological ChallengesIn the first studies on CMCs, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques were used to amplify different melanoma-specific transcripts. Several studies have showed that CTC detection is associated with disease progression in patients with advanced melanoma [26,27,28,29,30,31]. However, the use of CTC data for the management of patients with melanoma has not been incorporated in the clinical practice, probably because different, non-standardized methodologies were used. During the last decade, the CellSearch¬Æ system (Menarini Silicon Biosystems Inc), a standardized, US Food Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared methodology for CTC detection (for metastatic breast, colon and prostate cancer) has been intensively evaluated as a prognostic tool in patients with different metastatic solid tumors. A CellSearch¬Æ Circulating Melanoma Cell Kit is also available. Despite the limited number of studies on this kit, they all reported similar results: detection of two or more CMCs in approximately 25% of patients with metastatic melanoma, and significant association of CMC detection with overall survival (OS) [9,32,33]. In parallel, many other new technologies have been developed to overcome the challenge of CMC detection. Different microfluidic chips and biosensors have been tested in patients with melanoma [34,35,36,37,38,39,40]; however, the multiplicity of procedures reduces their potential clinical utility, like previously observed for RT-PCR-based methods.Another very new and interesting technology might overcome the low sensitivity of the available CTC assays by analyzing larger blood volumes. For instance, the in vivo photoacoustic flow cytometry platform uses a high pulse rate laser and focused ultrasound transducers for transcutaneous label-free detection of CMCs. This method is called ‚ÄúCytophone platform‚Äù, and detected individual CMCs, clots and CMC-clot emboli in 27 of the 28 patients with melanoma under study [22].  2.1.3. Clinical RelevanceCMCs as liquid biopsy are not routinely used in clinical practice because of the lack of robust and consistent results. As discussed before, the variety of technologies diminish the statistical power of the collected data. Furthermore, reproducible results, like those obtained with the CellSearch¬Æ CMC kit, are not yet of clinical interest because they evaluated the association between CMCs and OS only in patients with advanced disease and short survival probability and should be expanded to patients with non-metastatic melanoma.Most of the previously described technologies have been tested in patient cohorts enrolled in clinical trials to validate their potential clinical application. Among the eleven studies currently registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov database (Table 1), five are devoted to the technological validation and OS evaluation in patients with metastatic melanoma. This specific population is often preferred for the validation of new technologies because it is more likely to find high CMC numbers in patients with metastatic melanoma. The other six studies listed in the ClinicalTrials.gov database are assessing CTCs as biomarkers for monitoring the therapy response. The goal is to identify a biomarker that can predict therapy failure before clinical relapse. For instance, changes in the number of CTCs might reflect the treatment efficacy.Indeed, in these last years, several innovative systemic therapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma have emerged and novel first-line therapies have replaced conventional treatments. The FDA has approved several inhibitors that target the proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF mutated at V600E (BRAFV600E) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK), as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CLTA-4) and PD-1 for the management of patients with advanced-stage melanoma [41]. These therapies have greatly improved the OS of patients with advanced disease; however, some patients will not benefit from these treatments, and many will become resistant [42]. For example, although most patients responded well in the beginning of treatment to BRAF inhibitors, a rapid development of drug resistance has been observed while anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1 treatment demonstrated a durable response but only in a small fraction of patients (20‚Äì30% in monotherapy). With the widening of the indications for these therapies, clinicians are often faced with decisions concerning the clinical benefits relative to the risk of adverse events and the costs of these treatments.Interestingly, a new study evaluated whether PD-L1 expression on CTCs can serve as a predictive biomarker of clinical benefit and response to the anti-PD-1 treatment pembrolizumab on melanoma patients [43]. Their results showed better response rates in patients with PD-L1+ CTCs at baseline and an enhanced progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 months for PD-L1+ CTC patients compared with PD-L1‚àí CTC patients. These data suggest that PD-L1 expression on CTC may predict response to pembrolizumab in advanced melanoma patients. Even if these results need further validation in a larger cohort of patients, they indicate that liquid biopsy might be a useful tool to stratify patients more likely to respond to immunotherapy.  2.2. Circulating Tumor DNAAmong the many biomarkers used in melanoma, ctDNA is already considered a valuable tool for monitoring the therapy response [44,45,46]. For instance, it has been shown that the increase of ctDNA level in the plasma of patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma treated with targeted therapies precedes the detection of relapses by imaging and by clinical evaluation [47]. Moreover, the main explanation for targeted therapy failure is the emergence of new mutations in cancer cells that can bypass the initial molecular targets. Therefore, ctDNA might help to determine the new mutation landscape and to define new personalized therapeutic orientations. Finally, ctDNA can also be a source of genetic material for additional molecular investigations [3], including the longitudinal follow-up of the epigenetic profile during the disease course.   2.2.1. BiologyThe term ctDNA defines short DNA fragments (<166 pb) that are released from cancer cells in the circulation. They are a part of the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) present in plasma, usually released from cells in a state of apoptosis or necrosis. In cancer, the cell turn-over increases and leads to higher cfDNA amounts in plasma [48]. Several studies showed that ctDNA is a good biomarker for the follow-up of patients with metastatic cancer [49,50,51,52]. Indeed, due to it short half-life (about 2 h), it is representative of the real-time molecular changes in the tumor [53] and might alert about the emergence of new mutations. CtDNA has been used as a biomarker in patients with breast [54,55], colon [56] and lung [57,58] cancer, and its presence has been linked to the diagnosis [59,60], prognosis [61,62,63] and also follow-up of the disease [50,64,65,66,67,68]. CtDNA level has been associated with the overall response rate and also with PFS [47,69]. It also reflects the tumor mutational burden [70]. Therefore, ctDNA has a clinical value for cancer surveillance [47,71].   2.2.2. Technological ChallengesAs plasma contains a huge amount of biological material (e.g., cfDNA from healthy cells, exosomes.), technologies must be very sensitive to detect the low concentration of ctDNA relative to all the circulating DNA released from non-tumor cells. Technologies must also be sensitive enough to detect single-nucleotide mutations present at low frequency in ctDNA. In their review, Diefenbach et al. [72] listed the methods used to detect ctDNA in patients with melanoma and classified them in two main groups: PCR-based and sequencing-based methods. In the first group, droplet digital PCR [73,74] is sensitive, but needs the previous knowledge of the genetic rearrangements [75], like allele-specific PCR and the Beads, Emulsion, Amplification, Magnetics (BEAMing) digital PCR methods [76]. To try to improve detection of ctDNA mutation, such as BRAF or KRAS, some methods were developed, such as the Allele-Specific Locked Nucleic Acid Quantitative PCR (ASLNAqPCR) [77]. This method will block the amplification of wild-type sequences and the mutated sequences will then be increased and detection will be easier. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based approaches have the same limitations of PCR-based methods concerning the low abundance of ctDNA compared with standard sequencing samples. Among these methodologies, the Illumina, Thermofisher Ion Torrent and Roche sequencing platforms have already been used for ctDNA analysis in patients with melanoma. The cost of whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing is also a limitation and more targeted sequencing approaches could be envisaged [72]. In addition, as the typical NGS panels target common somatic driver mutations of cancer, some mutations linked to possible further resistance to treatment could also be included, such as those found in the BRAF and NRAS genes. Their detection could help to adapt the treatment for personalized medicine. To deal with the low abundance of ctDNA in the whole plasma, many rounds of PCR are needed to analyze ctDNA and differentiate it from other DNA sources. However, many PCR cycles could induce amplification mistakes. Some bioinformatic tools were developed to allow to distinguish ctDNA original mutations from PCR mistakes. For example, Duplex Sequencing (DS) based on barcode, integrated digital error suppression (iDES) which combine DS and a second background polishing, based on a healthy donor background model, or also PCR Error Correction (PEC), who discard redundancies on reads after alignment and allow to detect original reads [78]. All these computational tools will help to deal with the technological challenges of low-abundance ctDNA and permit to detect single nucleotide mutations to better adapt medicine for each patient.  2.2.3. Clinical RelevanceCtDNA can help to determine the tumor genetic heterogeneity and can be used as a biomarker for patient follow-up and the early detection of relapse. As ctDNA comes directly from the tumor and can reflect the mutational burden, it could specifically identify therapeutic targets, particularly when the solid tumor is not accessible. Relapse in patients with advanced melanoma (IIc, III and IV) could be monitored by following the ctDNA level. For example, an initial low level of ctDNA harboring the BRAFV600E mutation has been linked to better OS in patients with melanoma, while high level at diagnosis has been associated with shorter PFS and OS. Likewise, low ctDNA level at diagnosis is a good predictor of the response to immunotherapy in patients with advanced disease [76]. Conversely, ctDNA increase during treatment might reflect primary or secondary resistance to that targeted therapy. Moreover, clinical response of metastatic patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors can be monitored by levels of ctDNA, as the level of ctDNA at the initiation can be predictive of treatment response. It has been demonstrated that undetectable ctDNA level at baseline, as well as a decrease > 50% 3 weeks after treatment initiation are associated with better OS and PFS [79,80]. Concerning ctDNA molecular features, mutations in the BRAF, NRAS, KIT and TERT genes are considered melanoma-driving mutations and their detection could help to adapt the strategy for patient monitoring. Indeed, tumor progression mostly correlates with an increase of ctDNA with the same mutation, usually BRAFV600E [3].Currently, 16 clinical trials can be retrieved from the ClinicalTrials.gov database using the key words ‚Äúmelanoma‚Äù and ‚Äúcirculating DNA‚Äù, of which 11 are still open. Among these ongoing studies, six are assessing ctDNA prognostic value (for example, BRAF- or NRAF-mutated ctDNA), three are evaluating methods for ctDNA quantification and mutation detection and two are monitoring ctDNA level changes over time and their relationship with treatments (Table 2). In conclusion, ctDNA is a potential biomarker for the management and follow-up of patients with melanoma, although the optimization and standardization of the detection and analysis methods must be refined to obtain clinically significant results. Indeed, the many different approaches to detect ctDNA introduce experimental bias that prevents obtaining meaningful and robust data on ctDNA clinical relevance. Therefore, the standardization of the methods to detect ctDNA in patients with melanoma is mandatory before its implementation for the routine follow-up of patients as part of personalized medicine.   2.3. Other Circulating Biomarkers  2.3.1. ProteinsSeveral serum proteins might have diagnostic and prognostic value for melanoma, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), S100B and melanoma-inhibiting activity (MIA). However, according to the staging system by the American Joint Committee on Cancer, LDH is the only circulating protein with significant prognostic value in melanoma [81]. Specifically, elevated LDH concentration in patients with stage IV melanoma correlates with poor survival [82], and is a clinically significant factor associated with response, PFS and OS in patients treated with targeted [83] and immune therapies [84,85]. However, it is of clinical interest only for patients with metastatic melanoma.Among the proteins expressed and released by melanoma cells, the S100 family is the most studied [86,87]. S100B expression is increased in melanoma cells compared with melanocytes [82], and can be used for the staging of metastatic malignant melanoma by immunohistochemistry [88]. Moreover, serum S100B level is increased in patients with melanoma, independent of the cancer stage [89,90]. Its expression is clearly correlated with the presence of metastases, tumor burden, prognosis and survival [91,92]. S100B could also serve as a strong baseline marker of OS in patients with melanoma receiving anti-CTLA4 and/or anti-PD-1 antibodies [93,94].MIA is a soluble protein expressed by malignant melanoma cells [95]. This protein was proposed as a diagnostic serum marker of melanoma progression because the MIA ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) could correctly classify 100% of the investigated serum samples of patients with stage III and stage IV melanoma [96]. However, in a study that compared different serum proteins in 373 patients with melanoma, serum S100B showed the highest sensitivity for newly diagnosed metastases (0.86), followed by MIA (0.80), LDH (0.48) and albumin (0.15). Conversely, MIA displayed the lowest specificity (0.62) compared with albumin (0.99), LDH (0.98) and S100B (0.91) [97]. Similar results were reported by a more recent study in patients with stage II melanoma [98]. Therefore, MIA does not offer more advantages compared with S100B and LDH.  2.3.2. Circulating MicroRNAsCirculating miRNAs are emerging as potential non-invasive biomarkers for melanoma. miRNAs are directly released in the blood circulation during tumor cell apoptosis or necrosis, but also by cells via extracellular vesicles including exosomes, micro-vesicles and apoptotic bodies, which prevent their degradation by serum and plasma RNases [99]. In the blood, circulating miRNAs are associated with lipid particles, and/or are bound by protective proteins, such as argonaute-2 (AGO2) and nucleophosmin. Therefore, circulating miRNAs are very stable. Although miRNAs are present at extremely low concentrations in the circulation, they can be detected by standard techniques, including real-time quantitative RT-PCR.During the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that miRNA expression dysregulation in human malignancies directly contributes to the acquisition of cancer hallmarks [100]. Indeed, miRNAs play a critical role in the regulation of many cancer-relevant processes, such as cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis, by regulating the expression of oncogenes (tumor-suppressor miRNAs) and tumor-suppressor genes (oncogenic miRNAs). Several reviews have highlighted the role of miRNAs as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and as key molecular regulators in melanoma development [101,102,103]. For example, miR-137 is a well-established tumor suppressor miRNA often downregulated in melanoma and in many other cancer types. Its downregulation has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with melanoma [104]. This is not surprising because miR-137 inhibits invasion and migration of melanoma cell lines by directly targeting oncogenes, including the transcription factors TBX3, EZH2, c-MET and Y box-binding protein 1 (YB1) [105,106]. Several efforts have been made to identify circulating miRNAs that may be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for melanoma; however, due to the variety of profiling platforms and inputs, and the different techniques for serum and plasma preparation, RNA extraction, quality control, normalization and statistical evaluation, the results of the different studies show limited consistency.  2.3.3. ExosomesMelanoma cells produce various types of extracellular vesicles (EV), including micro-vesicles, apoptotic bodies and exosomes. The specific EV content and role in recipient cells depend on their molecular composition that is determined by their cell of origin. Cell type-specific proteins, lipids and nucleic acids can be detected in the respective EV populations, and this explains their prognostic and diagnostic value in specific conditions, including different cancer types [107]. Currently, few markers (i.e., TSG101, syntenin and the simultaneous expression of three tetraspanins (CD9, CD63 and CD81)) allows for distinguishing exosomes from other EVs, such as micro-vesicles and apoptotic bodies [108]. It is thought that exosomes secreted by cancer cells have critical roles in several tumor-related biological processes by promoting (1) survival and growth of the primary tumor through cell‚Äìcell communications between tumor and non-tumor cells, (2) tumor invasion through extracellular matrix remodeling and (3) angiogenesis [109]. Tumor-derived exosomes may also modulate the immune cell behavior, by dampening the anti-tumor immune response and promoting melanoma progression [109]. Conversely, exosomes secreted by immune cells may modulate melanoma cell behavior and exert therapeutic effects [103,110].Melanoma-derived and other EVs are generally isolated using established differential ultracentrifugation methods. This enables the separation of different EV types based on their sedimentation rate [111,112]. Other techniques, such as density gradient, precipitation, filtration, size-exclusion chromatography and immunological separation, have been employed with relative success in terms of EV recovery and specificity [113]. Then, electron microscopy, ELISA, flow cytometry and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) approaches are the most commonly used methods for the detection and quantification of exosomes [114,115]. Moreover, microfluidic chips also have the potential to be an emerging tool for exosome separation as well as detection applications with the improvement of using only a single chip for both steps [116]. However, at this stage, there is no recommended isolation/detection protocols and more comparative studies are needed.Clinically, EVs might become biomarkers of cancer progression, particularly for predicting and, hopefully, preventing future metastasis development, and also therapeutic targets. Hoshino et al. showed that the integrin expression profile of circulating plasma exosomes isolated from patients with cancer directs their tissue- and organ-specific colonization for metastasis [117]. Thus, it will be of interest to target the integrins expressed by these exosomes to prevent metastasis formation. Exosomes could also be used to develop new drug delivery strategies. Indeed, due to their ability to reach a specific tissue, exosomes are promising nano-vehicles for the bio-delivery of therapeutic RNAs, proteins and other agents [109]. Moreover, some recent studies have evaluated the role of exosomal PD-L1 expression in melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy [118,119] and provided a rationale for the application of exosomal PD-L1 as a biomarker to predict therapy response and clinical outcome.  2.4. ConclusionLiquid biopsy in melanoma has already showed its clinical relevance for the early diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of the disease. However, method standardization needs to be optimized to increase the clinical use and the clinical benefits of the biomarkers assessed by liquid biopsy. Finally, to reduce the costs linked to tumor surveillance and monitoring, data obtained by liquid biopsy might be used in the future to detect relapse before positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging (the current detection approach in patients with advanced melanoma).  3. Merkel Cell CarcinomaMCC is a rare skin cancer that usually appears as a pink/red, rapidly growing skin nodule on UV-exposed areas, such as head, neck and upper limbs. Usually, it is characterized by aggressive behavior and high metastasis rate without specific location [120]. Despite the currently low (but rapidly increasing) incidence (0.7 per 100,000) [121,122,123], MCC is associated with shorter disease-free and OS and higher cancer-related death rates than melanoma. To date, two main different oncogenic pathways have been identified [124,125]. The first is related to UV exposure with high tumor mutational burden, while the second one is related to a ubiquitous DNA virus, Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV). Although the involvement of this virus in MCC development has been clearly established, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully characterized. MCPyV was first described in 2008 by Feng et al. [126], and is the first human polyomavirus clearly linked to a human cancer [127]. Moreover, its epidemiological link with immunosuppressive conditions, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and solid organ transplantation, is well established [128,129].The hypothesis that MCC originates from epidermal Merkel cells [130] is supported by some common features between Merkel and MCC cells, such as the presence of a cytokeratin network as a dot, and the expression of cytokeratin-20 and neuron-specific enolase [131,132]. However, alternative theories have been proposed, involving, for example, a common cell ancestor with B lymphocytes [133]. Besides these debates on MCC cellular origin [131,134], recent studies tried to better understand the mechanisms underlying this malignancy, notably the involvement of the MCPyV virus that is detected in 80% of cases [124,127,135,136,137]. Currently, it is known that MCPyV is first present in cells in an episomal conformation [138] and is subsequently integrated in the cell DNA.As this tumor remains poorly understood, liquid biopsy might help to decipher its nature, the underlying mechanisms and might ensure a real-time follow-up of the disease and of its response to different treatments. Research on this topic is in its early days, but some studies have already investigated different circulating biomarkers in MCC (Table 3).  3.1. CTCs and Circulating miRNAsThe few studies on this topic show how little is known about MCC. Moreover, the existing data concern small patient cohorts, due to MCC rarity. Nevertheless, some circulating biomarkers might help to better understand MCC. CTCs have been associated with patient survival and MCC aggressiveness [139,140,143,145], and high miRNA-375 concentration in plasma with tumor burden [142,146]. Therefore, they are candidate biomarkers for MCC follow-up. In patients with MCC, CTCs are usually detected using the CellSearch¬Æ system [147,148,149], based on the positive enrichment of EpCAM-expressing cells. A new CTC detection method based on negative enrichment was investigated by Boyer et al. [144]. They evaluated CTC number to follow the disease course, and also characterized MCC CTCs (e.g., PD-L1 status). They found that CTC detection was associated with the cancer stage. The few studies on circulating miRNA in MCC used RT-qPCR as detection technology [142,150], like for other cancers [151,152]. The MCC miRNome has been investigated mostly in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples [153,154], and the miRNAs identified as MCC-specific could now be evaluated in liquid biopsies.   3.2. ExosomesExosomes are small vesicles secreted by different types of cells under the influence of cellular conditions and environment [155]. They might be used as an MCC biomarker. However, they have been investigated only in MCC cell lines and more data are needed. These preliminary studies suggest that exosomes might be a good candidate biomarker. Indeed, they showed that MCC-derived exosomes transport proteins linked to cancer, such as LDH and factors implicated in the p38 MAPK and Wnt signaling pathways. Importantly, these proteins were detected independently of the cell line MCPyV status [155], thus they could be used to monitor all patients with MCC.  3.3. Anti-MCPyV AntibodiesThe presence of MCPyV in most MCC specimens and the higher incidence in immune-deficient patients indicate the implication of the immune system in MCC [123,124]. The large T (LT) and small T (sT) antigens of MCPyV are involved in oncogenesis, for example their presence has been linked to cell cycle disturbance or viral replication. Moreover, LT is required for the survival of cancer cell lines [156]. Titration of the VP1 capsid protein of MCPyV has been used as a circulating biomarker of the viral load in patients. In these studies, high levels of anti-VP1 and anti-sT antibodies in blood was correlated with better outcome [157], and anti-LT antibodies are a prognostic factor of recurrence if they are detected more than one year after diagnosis [141].  3.4. ImmunotherapyAn immunohistochemical analysis of MCC specimens found that many cancer cells express PD-L1, particularly when they are in close proximity to infiltrating immune cells [158]. This mechanism is used by MCC cells to escape immunity. Specifically, cancer cells express PD-L1 at their surface, and its interaction with PD-1 at the surface of immune cells will block their identification as cancer cells. This phenomenon has been highlighted in many different cancers and is one of the immune checkpoints targeted by immunotherapy. Recently, immunotherapy based on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition [159,160,161] has been approved by the US FDA for patients with metastatic MCC. This therapy has already been used in other cancers for some years [162] and is also efficient in patients with metastatic MCC, although the response rate remains unsatisfactory [159,163]. Detection of PD-L1 at the surface of CTCs could help for MCC patient management. This emphasizes the need of better understanding this disease to develop more appropriate treatments. A query of the ClinicalTrials.gov database with the keyword ‚ÄúMerkel cell carcinoma‚Äù in November 2019 did not retrieve any ongoing study on circulating biomarkers in MCC. Most of the listed studies were testing new treatments.   3.5. ConclusionLiquid biopsy in MCC could be of clinical interest for patient management, as suggested by the correlation of CTCs and circulating miRNAs with disease outcomes and tumor burden. However, more research must be done in larger cohorts and on different potential candidate biomarkers.   4. DiscussionThe potential use of liquid biopsy in melanoma has already been extensively studied and some circulating biomarkers are clinically relevant (Figure 1). Conversely, few but encouraging data are available in the context of MCC, due to its rarity. The detection of circulating biomarkers in blood is challenging, but technological advances help to deal with their scarcity in liquid biopsies (Figure 2). Circulating biomarkers help to assess the tumor heterogeneity in real-time, unlike conventional biopsy that is representative only of the sampling site. Therefore, liquid biopsy could be clinically relevant in these two skin cancers, for prognosis and staging, and also for the follow-up of patients (Figure 1). In the future, information gained from liquid biopsies might be used to indicate when restaging is needed, or when surveillance is sufficient for patients without evidence of micro-metastatic tumor burden in the blood. Recent studies have shown that the micro-metastatic tumor burden is often increased before the clinical evidence of metastasis by imaging. In the future, both therapy and imaging decision-making might be guided by the data obtained by liquid biopsy. Liquid biopsy could become a really useful tool for the personalized management of patients with melanoma, among whom relapse and resistance to immunotherapy are common, or with MCC, where the risk of aggressive disease is very high. Many studies have proven the value of liquid biopsy in melanoma. On the other hand, clinical studies must be performed in patients with MCC to confirm the relevance of the circulating biomarkers tested in small patient cohorts. Some multi-national projects have been established, such as the European Liquid Biopsy Society (ELBS) or the International Society of Liquid Biopsy (ISLB), to expand the use of circulating biomarkers.

Abstract:
  Simple SummaryMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an uncommon type of skin cancer that carries a poor prognosis. It is seen predominantly in old age in sun-exposed body parts. Racial and geographical differences are seen in its occurrence. Viral infection and radiation exposure are the two leading factors implicated in its causation. Small, firm to hard nodule (usually in sun-exposed areas), red with a history of a rapid increase in size is a common personation of the disease. Other body parts such as upper limbs, trunk, and even lower limbs may be also involved. The disease is diagnosed by taking a tissue sample (biopsy) for examination, and other radiological investigations are needed to reach a proper diagnosis with the staging of the disease. There are various treatment options including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Surgery is the primary treatment option though some patients may not be the candidates for operation where other treatment options come into play.  AbstractMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an infrequent, rapidly growing skin neoplasm that carries a greater probability of regional lymph node involvement, and a grim prognosis in advanced cases. While it is seen predominantly in old age in sun-exposed body parts, the prevalence varies among different races and geographical regions. Merkel cell polyomavirus and UV radiation-induced mutations contribute to its etiopathogenesis. The clinical presentation of MCC lacks pathognomonic features and is rarely considered highly at the time of presentation. Histopathological examination frequently reveals hyperchromatic nuclei with high mitotic activity, but immunohistochemistry is required to confirm the diagnosis. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and imaging are advised for effective staging of the disease. Multimodal management including surgery, radiation therapy, and/or immunotherapy are deployed. Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies may result in an initial response, but do not result in a significant survival benefit. Checkpoint inhibitors have dramatically improved the prognosis of patients with metastatic MCC, and are recommended first-line in advanced cases. There is a need for well-tolerated agents with good safety profiles in patients who have failed immunotherapies.

  1. IntroductionMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an infrequent, rapidly growing skin neoplasm initially described by Cyril Toker in the year 1972. The ‚Äúcell of origin‚Äù of MCC is yet to be fully substantiated. Based on the similarities in biology and morphology of the ‚ÄòMerkel cells‚Äô (MC), which are epidermal cells with both epithelial and neuroendocrine attributes and MCC, it has been postulated to arise from the MCs and is thus occasionally described as neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. Epidermal stem cells, dermal fibroblasts, B cell precursors, and neuronal precursor cells have all been proposed as possible cells of origin for MCC [8]. Though MCC can involve any anatomical part/region in the human body, it occurs predominantly in the solar unshielded body parts in older males, with numerous studies substantiating the effects of long-term ultra-violet radiation exposure [3,4]. Most importantly, MCC is strongly associated with immunosuppression, both iatrogenic and age-related [4,5,6,9,10,11,12,13,14]. It is frequently associated with regional lymphadenopathy and disseminated disease can spread to many parts of the body. The high mortality rate renders it twice as deadly as melanoma [3,4,15].  2. EpidemiologyThe etiopathogenesis of MCC involves an intricate mutual interaction among various intrinsic and extrinsic factors and influences. Although the specific cause is yet to be determined, two aetiologies that have been widely discussed and postulated include viral oncogenesis and radiation [3,6,9,15]. The identification of MC polyomavirus (MCPyV) in most tumor specimens by Feng et al. proved to be a landmark study in our understanding of its biology. Furthermore, a study by Touz√© A et al. in 2009 confirmed this association of MCPyV with MCC [16,17]. While the precise mechanisms by which MCPyV promotes tumorigenesis are debatable, the expression of MCPyV early region genes plays a critical role in oncogenesis. UV radiation appears to synergize with MCPyV to promote tumorigenesis, and it has been suggested that mutations to the viral genome promote viral integration and tumorigenesis [5]. Notably, psoriasis patients on phototherapy treatment are 100 times more predisposed to develop MCC, and correlations between MCC and radiation index and decreased skin pigmentation have been noted [15,16]. Accordingly, the predominant, but not exclusive, sites of involvement are exposed parts including the head and uncovered areas of the upper limbs (Figure 1) [17,18,19]. A compromised immune system is also a well-established risk factor for MCC; iatrogenic immune suppression, lymphoproliferative disorders such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, autoimmune disorders, organ transplant candidates, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are known to increase the likelihood of MCC [18,19,20]. The high prevalence of MCC in older patients suggests that immunosenescence may contribute as well [5,6].MCC occurs less frequently than melanoma, squamous, or basal cell cancers [16]. Although the incidence appears to be increasing in the previous few decades, the rarity of the tumor hinders the assessment of the true incidence. Improved diagnostic techniques, a growing elderly population, and an increase in the number of immune-compromised patients may all be contributing to the rise in incidence [2,21]. Incidence rates vary across different parts of the world. As is true for other UV radiation-induced cutaneous malignancies, Australia tops the list with the incidence of 16 cases per million population [15]. Notably, the incidence of MC Polyoma virus-positive cases is low in Australia [11]. The age-adjusted annual incidence from the United States, Europe, and Australasia lies between 0.1 and 1.6 per 100,000, with the number of cases reported from Asia the lowest [3,15]. In the United States, about 1600 new cases are detected every year [5,6,9].The frequency of MCC differs among varied ethnic clusters and regional zones-prevalence being 25 times higher in the white population than dark skin types. The classic patient is an elderly white man aged above 70 years with a history of prolonged sun exposure [15,22]. The age-adjusted incidence rate is 8 times lower in the black populace [5,9,15]. Most studies confirm that males outnumber females; with some demonstrating a gender ratio of up to 2:1. However, though some small studies have demonstrated either not predilection or a slight female preponderance [17,22]. Females tend to be older than males at presentation (76 years vs. 71 years) [13]. The lesions are mostly encountered in the head with the trunk the favored location in younger patients and lower limbs in African Americans [5].Following past studies, the mean age at diagnosis in most recent studies is reported to be 74.9 years. It is extremely rare in children and young people, being 24 times more common after 65 years of age and only 5% diagnosed before 50 years. Two studies (one from New Zealand and another US-based) demonstrated an enhancement in the age-specific incidence in old age group patients when compared with a younger group [6,22].  3. Clinical PresentationThe clinical manifestations of MCC are protean and are rarely suspected at the time of presentation [5,15,16]. One common presentation is a single, firm to hard, rounded, red to violaceous nodule or tumors that are non-tender and rapidly growing [22,23]. (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3).The tumors are observed more commonly on the left side than on the right. Such an observation has not revealed any correlation with the radiation exposure, age, sex, site predilection, or MCPyV status [24]. The explanation for such laterality of the lesions continues to remain indeterminate. Gambichler T et al. reported the left-sided predominance of the tumors in the ratio of 8:I (torso), 1.8:1 (head and lower limbs) and 1.2:1 (upper limbs), et [24] Lesion tends to grow as hemispheres towards the outside (giving typical dome shape) or in an iceberg fashion to inside [10]. Rapid growth with ulceration can be observed.Multiple morphologic features including papules, plaques, cysts, pruritic growths, stalked neoplasms, deep cutaneous masses, and lesions with telangiectasia, have all have been reported in the literature [15,16]. The majority (70‚Äì90%) of these lesions have an affinity for the head/neck or upper extremities (Figure 1). Head and neck lesions are typically smaller than those from other regions [16]. Additional diagnoses in the differential may include basal/squamous cell carcinoma (BCC/SCC), lymphoma cutis, pyogenic granuloma, sarcoma, epidermal inclusion cyst, dermatofibroma, adipose tumor, melanoma (amelanotic type), or metastatic lesions, and should be differentiated from them through biopsy [16,23]. Carneiro et al. reported concomitant malignancy in 18.7% of patients in the form of BCC, SCC, and sebaceous carcinoma [9]. Heath et al. have devised an initialism (AEIOU) to elucidate the typical manifestations of MCC: asymptomatic, rapid expansion, immune suppression, old age (>50), and ultraviolet radiation exposure. In his study, ‚â•3 of these traits were found in about 89% of the patients [14,15]. Mucosal MCC‚Äôs (e.g., oral/genital), although rare, have been reported to be more aggressive than the cutaneous ones [15,16]. At presentation, localized cutaneous disease is documented in about two-thirds of patients; however, cases with the nodal disease at presentation are not infrequent. The US National Cancer Database reveals two-thirds of patients presenting with localized tumor followed by draining lymph node basin adenopathy in 27%, while 7% exhibit metastasis to remote areas. In contrast, the SEER Program reported local disease in <50% cases with the same percentage of metastasis. In 14% of patients, despite the documented metastasis, the primary tumor cannot be identified [13,18]. It is to be emphasized that ‚Äò‚Äòvisceral MCC‚Äô‚Äô without any skin manifestation is currently regarded as a distinct subtype of neuroendocrine carcinoma [5,13,15]. This should be distinguished from nodal only MCC, which is thought to be MCC with spontaneous resolution of the cutaneous lesion. Importantly, MCC in situ is extremely rare. Basically, these are dermal tumors, as already described, with the involvement of epidermis alone extremely unusual; only a very few cases of such stage 0 disease are reported in the literature [25].  4. EtiopathogenesisThe pathogenesis of MCC is partially known. In addition, the cell of genesis for MCC also remains unclear and is currently debated [6,10]. Merkel cells, named as ‚Äò‚Äòtouch cells,‚Äô‚Äô when originally reported by Frederich Merkel long back in 1876, are seen mainly in the basal layer of the epidermis. They are physiologically implicated in tactile response and somatostatin production and have a presumed role in other endocrine functions. This explains the historical designation of ‚Äò‚Äòneuroendocrine‚Äô‚Äô for MCC tumors [5,6,9,10]. While MCC‚Äôs are broadly classified into 3 histological subtypes‚Äîtrabecular, intermediate, and small cell‚Äîthere is not yet any substantiation for the clinical utility of such classifications [2,3]. The trabecular type (least common) is well-differentiated and is commonly observed in mixed tumors. The intermediate type is most common (observed in ‚â•50% of tumors) with high mitotic activity. The small-cell type is poorly/undifferentiated and appears similar to small cell carcinoma of other locations, especially the lung [22,23]. Pathologically, MCC is typically located in the dermis and occasionally in the sub-dermis with sparing of the epidermis in general [25]. At times, the monotonous appearance of the ‚Äúsmall round cells‚Äù in the dermal layer and subdermal adipose tissue, makes MCC indistinguishable from malignant lymphomas with immunohistochemical stains [26,27]. A range of trabecular, insular, or diffuse growth patterns may be seen, with either one or all patterns coexisting within an individual tumor. The dermis is often filled, with a very narrow area of uninvolved papillary dermis set apart from the epidermis by a slender zone called the ‚ÄòGrenz zone‚Äô. The cytoplasm can be visualized as a thin acidophilic rim and is amphophilic to eosinophilic. The following are some histopathologic pictures of MCC (Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6).The nuclei are relatively uniform and grayish being round and vesicular, having a typical fine granular ‚Äúpepper and salt‚Äù appearing chromatin motif and multiple nucleoli; hyperchromatic nuclei and high mitotic activity are characteristic [4]. Mitotic figures are abundant and fragmented nuclei are plentiful. Necrosis may be present, occasionally associated with hematoxylin staining of vessel walls and fibrous septa known as the ‚ÄúAzzopardi phenomenon‚Äù [28]. These histological features need to be distinguished from other so-called ‚Äòsmall round cell tumor‚Äô groups as well as from melanoma. Accurate diagnostic discrimination of these entities is critically important for predicting long-term prognosis determining the appropriate treatment. As no histologic features can reliably distinguish MCC from other small round cell tumors, immunohistochemical stains prove useful in excluding these differentials [19]. Immunohistochemically, MCC shows positivity for low molecular weight keratin and neurofilaments, which appear as dot-like condensations of filaments. In particular, it is strongly positive for keratin type 20 with distinct dots concentrated around the nucleus [9,29,30]. CK20 and neurofilament positivity and Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) negativity are important to designate MCC from histologically similar neoplasms. CK20 staining in MCC is often dot-like but a decoration of the cytoskeleton is also possible [31,32,33]. In rare cases, MCC may stain for CK7, while being negative for CK20 [34]; CK19 has its diagnostic significance for CK20-negative MCC [35]. Consequently, tumors that are positive for CK20 along with TTF-1 negativity indicate MCC [22,23]. Immunohistochemical demonstration of neuron-specific enolase, intense staining for keratin (CK20), and absence of S100 protein, leukocyte common antigen, vimentin, and HMB45 are enough to confirm the diagnosis [35,36] (Table 1). In addition to the above-mentioned markers, cases of MCC manifest reactivity with chromogranin, synaptophysin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P, pancreatic polypeptide, calcitonin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, somatostatin, other peptide hormones, PAX-5, TdT, glypican-3, and CD117 [37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44].  5. Diagnostic Evaluation/StagingDiagnostic evaluation starts with proper history and clinical examination. Quite atypical and diverse gross manifestations constitute diagnostic challenges even for experienced clinicians. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is advocated in most cases for definitive disease staging since 33% of the patients with clinical evidence of primary disease harbor occult disease in draining lymph node basin [15,18].The guidelines from the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for diagnostic evaluation include: differentiation from nodal only MCC, which is thought to be MCC with spontaneous resolution of the cutaneous lesion, imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), or positron emission tomography (PET) can be performed as clinically indicated; and when possible, individual cases ought to be discussed in a multi-facility tumor board of the institution [14,16,22]. According to the updated American Joint Committee on Cancer (AGCC) staging system for MCC (Table 2), according to life expectancy, patients are categorized into different groups. This staging system blends clinical and pathological elements of the disease to facilitate appropriate treatment strategies. Additionally, it regrouped pathologically confirmed nodal disease with unconfirmed primary lesion into stage IIIA, highlighting the improved clinical outcomes connected to it [13,14,15].  6. Prognostic Factors and Disease ProgressionUsually, MCC does not have a good prognosis, especially when the initial presentation is that of metastatic disease. Despite substantial insights into the tumor biology of MCC, survival rates continue to be poor for advanced disease. Until the advent of checkpoint inhibitor treatment, the main therapeutic option for advanced MCC has been chemotherapy, where there have been seen initially good responses though without any significant survival benefit. With the advent of checkpoint inhibitors, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are refined dramatically in advanced disease. A single-arm trial with Pembrolizumab/Avelumab leads to the approval of the use of checkpoint inhibitors by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of advanced MCC [45,46]. The estimated overall five-year survival for local disease is 51% whereas it stands at 14% for metastatic disease. A study from the Netherlands reported 1-, 5-, and 10-year relative survival of 85%, 62%, and 47%, respectively [47]. However, the 5-year survival rate in a study by Agelli and Clegg was reported to be 75%, 59%, and 25% for local, regional, and distant disease, respectively [7]. A study by Tam et al. revealed that females have a survival advantage over men [48]. Disease-associated mortality is rated at 33‚Äì46%, which markedly surpasses that seen in melanoma patients, assigning it as the second leading cause of skin cancer death [15,22]. Recurrence is usually encountered during the initial 2 years of disease. Frohm et al. observed a mean of 10.7 months for the first recurrence to appear with a range of 3.5 to 23.3 months [49]. MCV positivity is known to predict favorable outcomes when compared to similar tumors that are MCPyV negative [4,15,19]. A subset of MCPyV-positive patients produce MCPyV-specific antibodies, which also serve as a favorable prognostic factor. The presence of antibodies against an MCPyV T antigen, but not capsid protein antibodies, predicts recurrent or progressive disease if observed 1-year post tumor excision [50]. Furthermore, CD8 T cell counts in the neoplasm are considered to predict survival; a study by Feldmeyer et al. proposed tumoral immune infiltrates as a strong prognostic indicator [51]. Finally, some histologic and immunohistochemical features have been reported to predict disease progression. Specifically, rapid mitosis, small cell morphology, the paucity of inflammatory infiltrates, lymphovascular involvement, p53 positivity, p63 positivity, raised mast cell-cell counts, and dense tumoral/peritumoral vascularity all have been proposed to be negative predictors, with p63 exhibiting the greatest prognostic value [52,53,54,55,56,57]. The strongest negative prognostic indicators include male gender, advanced age, comorbid conditions, immunocompromised state, head and neck localization, tumor of 2 cm or more, advanced stage (clinically presence of lymph nodes, distant metastases), and positive resection margins [5,9]. It is worth noting that the time interval between the presentation and initiation of treatment is crucial to prognosticate the disease progression [4]. The prognostic utility of tumor thickness continues to be controversial. While some authors indicated that a nodal disease with a poor prognosis is related to tumor thickness, others have refuted it [9].Nodal MCC without any evidence of a primary tumor is associated with improved survival, perhaps due to an active immune-mediated clearance of the cutaneous tumor before its presentation. A potential immunological clearance of the carcinoma is seconded by several reports of spontaneous regression of the tumor including distant metastatic ones [15,16]. Advancement to metastatic disease is classically noticed within the first 3 years of diagnosis. Distant metastasis has most commonly been observed in the liver, lung, brain, bones, and remote skin. Less frequent sites of advanced disease include gastrointestinal epithelia, pancreas, parotid gland, pleura, cardiac tissue, bone marrow, prostate, testicles, and urinary bladder [13,16,18].  7. Treatment OptionsDepending upon the clinical stage, comorbidities, and performance status of the patient, multimodality management protocols consisting of extirpation of the primary lesion, regional lymphadenectomy with radiotherapy/chemotherapy is being employed as the optimal treatment. However, at present, there is debate on the most efficacious treatment scheme for the advanced disease; moreover, it should be distinguished from nodal only MCC, which is thought to be MCC with spontaneous resolution of the cutaneous lesion [9,10,11].Operative management is the gold standard for localized or locoregional disease. Wide excision with a margin of 1‚Äì2 cm (1 cm for <2 cm tumor size and 2 cm for >2 cm ones) is usually recommended [15,20]. Surgery resulting in positive margins is a candidate for re-excision. In sites where tissue sparing is critical, Mohs microsurgery may be an option, but lack of unanimity precludes its utility. Lymph node dissection followed by radiation is the standard treatment for Stage III disease. SLNB is typically recommended at the time of the primary surgery for the cases without nodes on clinical examination. For those with positive SLNB, elective lymph node dissection (ELND) with radiation is the norm [13,20].Radiotherapy (RT) is utilized both as an adjuvant to surgery and as a monotherapy in those in whom surgery is not conducive or suitable, e.g., an elderly patient with a plethora of comorbidities with high risk for anesthesia/surgery. Most frequently, it is employed for the locoregional control of the disease. Most literature suggests that recurrence rates are considerably reduced with adjuvant RT, which has better results than adjuvant chemotherapy [58,59,60,61]. The cumulative radiation dosage regimen for the primary site ranges between 50 and 56 Gy for margin negative surgery with dosage enhancement up to 60 Gy for positive histological margins and a maximum of 66 Gy for gross disease (standard fractions ranging from 1.8 to 2 Gy per session) (Table 3) [58].Cook et al. stated that postoperative single-fraction radiotherapy is a promising option to conventionally fractionated postoperative radiotherapy to treat the primary lesion in localized head/neck Merkel cell tumors, particularly in elderly and frail patients (not candidates for surgery), with potential control of disease without noticeable toxicity [62]. A retrospective study in the Moffitt Cancer Center revealed that postsurgical radiation improves disease control as well as disease-specific survival in cases having positive nodal disease, but without any effect in patients with no nodal involvement. The international guidelines recommend that adjuvant radiation should be initiated within 4‚Äì6 weeks of surgery for all stages of the disease (I‚ÄìIII). (NCCN 2021) [63]. In general, for large node-negative tumors, consensus panels and international guidelines agree that adjuvant RT following operative extirpation improves the local control in the tumor bed, whereas controversy continues for its use in stage III disease, except for those with multiple lymph nodes with confirmed extracapsular extension [59]. The National Cancer Database analysis [64] has validated that the adjuvant RT improves overall survival in stage I and II patients, but not in stage III disease. This was further confirmed in a multicenter retrospective study by Servy et al. [65]. which concluded that survival in stage III depends on the presence/absence of subclinical distant metastases rather than the inclusion of specific adjuvant therapy [59].Radiation monotherapy has most commonly been reported in head and neck tumors [59]. Ott et al. [66] reported a prolonged remission in four such patients. Similarly, Lawenda et al. concluded that radiation to the primary tumor bed, either definitive or as an adjuvant following resection, could produce a local control rate exceeding 90% [61]. Mortier et al. demonstrated the validity of managing inoperable cases by RT alone, with the results at least equal to ones managed by surgery and radiotherapy [60]. In addition, good results have been witnessed with single-fraction radiation therapy in metastatic tumors. It reduced the tumor burden with durable palliation and limited side effects [12,13,14,15,16]. Palliation of bone metastases and other extracranial metastatic sites can be achieved with 10 fractions of 3 Gy each and/or a single 8 Gy fraction. The University of Washington reported complete responses in 45% and local control in 77% cases of metastatic tumors when treated with a single 8 Gy fraction [58].Though MCC is generally regarded as a chemotherapy-responsive tumor, results are hardly ever durable. There are no documented favorable results and clear benefits with the use of chemotherapeutic regimens. It is typically reserved for palliative therapy in stage IV disease where other treatments have failed. Cytotoxic chemotherapies tend to increase morbidity and reduce the quality of life with their associated immunosuppression and toxicity. Resistance to chemotherapy on recurrence is another drawback. Usual drug regimens comprise cisplatin/carboplatin with etoposide/topotecan [12,13,14].Immunotherapy has materialized as a promising management tool for advanced MCC. Various research papers have corroborated the association of immune status to clinical outcomes, opening the way for beneficial effects of cell-mediated immunity [67]. Three antibodies targeting the PD-1 axis have been extensively studied, with all exhibiting significant response rates and good response durability (Table 4).Among these, pembrolizumab (anti‚ÄìPD-1) was the first immune inhibitor demonstrating tumor regression [67]. A National Cancer Institute-sponsored clinical trial studied the effect of pembrolizumab in 25 cases of advanced disease, showing an ORR of 56% including a 16% complete response rate (CRR) and an estimated progression-free survival (PFS) of 67% (at 6 months) with the response duration ranging from 2.2 to 9.7 months. ORR did not differ significantly in virus-negative and virus-positive tumors (62% vs. 44%). Based on these observations, pembrolizumab has been recommended for disseminated MCC (National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines). Nghiem et al., in another multicenter phase II trial (Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network-09) involving 50 cases of advanced MCC, treated with pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks) for up to 2 years, showed an objective response rate (ORR) of 56% (complete response 24%; partial response 32%; 95% CI, 41.3% to 70.0%), with ORRs of 59% in virus-positive and 53% in virus-negative tumors. The 24-month PFS rate was 48.3%, and the median PFS time was 16.8 months (95% CI, 4.6 months to not estimable) with the 24-month OS rate of 68.7% [46]. Nivolumab is another monoclonal PD-1 antibody with clinical efficacy in advanced tumors. Twenty-five patients‚Äîtreatment-na√Øve and previously treated (36% and 64%, respectively), MCPyV-positive/negative, advanced MCC‚Äîwere enrolled and treated with nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks with a median follow-up of 51 weeks. Investigators observed an ORR of 64% and PFS of 82% at 3 months. Avelumab, a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, was approved by the FDA in 2017. Approval was based on data from an open-label, single-arm, multi-center phase 2 clinical trial. In this study, 88 patients with advanced stage received avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. This trial demonstrated an ORR of 33%, with a CRR of 11% and PFS of 40% (at 24 weeks) with the estimated PFS of 30% at 12 months. Unlike pembrolizumab, ORR was not significantly different in virus-positive/negative tumors (26% and 35%) [45,68]. The results of the above-described trials led to the inclusion of avelumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab in the NCCN guidelines (in January 2018) as the preferred treatment options for disseminated disease (Table 4) [67,69,70,71]. With the advent of ICIs, for the first time, long-lasting response durability was observed in patients with advanced MCC. Even if adverse events due to checkpoint inhibitors are known, re-induction is a treatment option in case of tumor progression. Stefe et al., in a retrospective multicenter study, evaluated patients with re-induction of anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy; following a mean treatment-free period of 9.5 months (3‚Äì18 months), re-induction with ICI therapy achieved an objective response in five of eight patients (62.5%) upon re-induction, while no response could be observed in the rest. Notably, adverse events compelling halt of treatment were not observed during reinduction [70].A variety of agents belonging to other classes have been tried in some cases. TNF-a, interferon-a (IFN-a), anti-CD56 antibodies, or vaccines (IL-12 gene using vaccine) have all been reported beneficial in case reports or small series. Though case series/reports regarding the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Imatinib, cabozantinib, and pazopanib), and somatostatin analogs (lanreotide, octreotide, and pasireotide) do exist, clinical trials supporting their use have not yet been conducted, therefore, these agents are not included in management protocols [10,12,20]. In advanced tumors, various intralesional immunotherapies were tried. Intralesional therapy with tumor necrosis factor, class I interferon, and talimogene laherparepvec (T-vec) have revealed promising results. Intralesional TLR4 agonist and IL-12 administration (through electroporation) resulted in persistent objective responses in individuals with advanced disease in early-phase trials. Currently, trials are in place for T-vec alone or incorporation with radiation or nivolumab, and TTI-621 (anti-CD47). Furthermore, a phase I/II trial of intralesional TLR7/8 agonist plus a modified IL-2 formulation has been initiated. Though none have been approved yet, still, one more triple-combination study of tremelimumab (an anti‚ÄìCTLA-4 antibody), durvalumab (an anti‚ÄìPD-L1 antibody), and intratumoral TLR3 agonist poly-ICLC is underway [71].  8. ConclusionsAlthough substantial insight into the pathogenesis and advancements in the treatment protocols have been achieved in the recent past, mortality rates and projections have improved little in advanced-stage disease. The tumor stage at the time of presentation is still the most dependable prognostic predictor. Multiple management modalities must be tailored to minimize morbidity while maximizing the chances of survival. The continued development of well-tolerated immuno-therapies with acceptable side effects profiles may improve treatment options for patients with recurrent or persistent disease. Despite the increasing incidence, few institutions manage enough patients that they can effectively analyze the data regarding the efficacy and safety of different treatment options on their own. Hence, prospective, multicenter, randomized case-control studies should be considered to continue to refine and standardize treatment guidelines.

Abstract
The microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare, locally aggressive malignant adnexal neoplasm associated with signifi cant morbidity. It is often underdiagnosed due to clinical and histopathological resemblance with other cutaneous neoplasms and / or a combination of lack of familiarity associated with inadequate samples. We report a case with clinical hypothesis of scarring alopecia and histopathological diagnosis of microcystic adnexal carcinoma with favorable outcome in a follow-up of eleven years, after surgical treatment.
Keywords:Alopecia; Pathology; Skin neoplasms


INTRODUCTION
Adnexal cutaneous tumors represent a diverse and broad spectrum of tumors originated from hair, sebaceous glands, apocrine and eccrine glands, encompassing numerous subgroups of both benign and malignant appendicular neoplastic processes.11¬†Goldstein DJ, Barr RJ, Santa Cruz DJ. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: A distinct clinicopathologic entity. Cancer. 1982;50:566-72.

Microcystic Adnexal Carcinoma (MAC) is a malignant adnexal cutaneous neoplasm, rare, with follicular differentiation, indolent, locally aggressive, of invasive pattern and destructive, rarely evolving with metastases and easily mistaken, clinically and histologically, for other cutaneous neoplasms, both benign and malignant.11¬†Goldstein DJ, Barr RJ, Santa Cruz DJ. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: A distinct clinicopathologic entity. Cancer. 1982;50:566-72.

Due to its innocuous clinical appearance and slow progression, a delay between onset of lesion and diagnosis is frequently observed.22¬†Abbate M, Zeitouni NC, Seyler M, Hicks W, Loree T, Cheney RT. Clinical course, risk factors, and treatment of microcystic adnexal carcinoma: a short series report. Dermatol Surg. 2003;29:1035-8.

We present a clinical case of MAC with initial diagnostic hypothesis of scarring alopecia.
CASE REPORT
Female patient, white, 67 years old, presenting a whitish hardened plaque, with a smooth and shiny surface, without hairs, painless and measuring about 5 cm in diameter in the occipital region (Figure 1). Such findings led to a clinical hypothesis of scarring alopecia. Initially, the histopathological report of the fragment obtained by punch biopsy was a neoplastic process of epithelial lineage, infiltrative and with syringomatoid differentiation.33¬†Rotter N, Wagner H, Fuchshuber S, Issing WJ. Cervical metastases of microcystic adnexal carcinoma in an otherwise healthy woman. Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. 2003;260:254-7.Later, histopathology of the surgical piece, after augmented excision of the tumor, revealed an infiltrative neoplastic process with areas of syringomatoid differentiation and areas of follicular differentiation, suggesting low degree Microcystic Adnexal Carcinoma infiltrating dermis and hypodermis, with compromised surgical margins (Figures 2,3and4). A third augmented excision, with the confection of cutaneous flap, was performed and it still presented residual neoplasm, although with free surgical margins. A fourth reparative surgery was necessary for the reconstitution of extensive and deep losses of tissue in the scalp, with bone exposure resulting from previous augmented resection of the tumor. Postoperative evolution was satisfactory and the patient remains asymptomatic, without relapse of the disease in eleven years of clinical follow-up.

DISCUSSION
The study of epidemiological characteristics and natural history of MAC is difficult in light of the rarity of this neoplasm.33¬†Rotter N, Wagner H, Fuchshuber S, Issing WJ. Cervical metastases of microcystic adnexal carcinoma in an otherwise healthy woman. Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. 2003;260:254-7.It predominates in females and usually manifests itself between the 4th and 6th decade of life, although there are reports of occurrences in children.44¬†Leibovitch I, Huilgol SC, Selva D, Lun K, Richards S, Paver R. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: treatment with Mohs micrographic surgery. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2005;52:295-300.,55¬†Callahan EF, Vidimos AT, Bergfeld WF. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) of the scalp with extensive pilar differentiation. Dermatol Surg. 2002;28:536-9.It occurs more frequently in white patients, being rare in blacks. It demonstrates predilection for the head, particularly the periorbital and nasolabial regions.33¬†Rotter N, Wagner H, Fuchshuber S, Issing WJ. Cervical metastases of microcystic adnexal carcinoma in an otherwise healthy woman. Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. 2003;260:254-7.Lesions on the neck, scalp and orbit are rare.66¬†Clement CI, Genge J, O'Donnell BA, Lochhead AG. Orbital and periorbital microcystic adnexal carcinoma. Ophthal Plast Reconstr Surg. 2005;21:97-102.,77¬†Chiller K, Passaro D, Scheuller M, Singer M, McCalmont T, Grekin RC. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: forty-eight cases, their treatment, and their outcome. Arch Dermatol. 2000;136:1355-9.

Its etiology is unknown, with evidences that therapeutic cutaneous irradiation, UV radiation and immunodeficiency are predisposing factors.44¬†Leibovitch I, Huilgol SC, Selva D, Lun K, Richards S, Paver R. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: treatment with Mohs micrographic surgery. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2005;52:295-300.

The typical clinical presentation is a plaque or a poorly-defined and hardened nodule, solitary, skin colored to yellowish, smooth surface, rarely ulcerated, of slow growth and usually painless, measuring 0.5 to 2 cm, but reaching up to 12 cm in its largest diameter.22¬†Abbate M, Zeitouni NC, Seyler M, Hicks W, Loree T, Cheney RT. Clinical course, risk factors, and treatment of microcystic adnexal carcinoma: a short series report. Dermatol Surg. 2003;29:1035-8.In general it is asymptomatic, but it can manifest pain, burning, stinging sensation, anesthesia or paresthesia arising from perineural invasion. It is locally aggressive, with potential of tissue destruction; metastases have been reported.33¬†Rotter N, Wagner H, Fuchshuber S, Issing WJ. Cervical metastases of microcystic adnexal carcinoma in an otherwise healthy woman. Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. 2003;260:254-7.,66¬†Clement CI, Genge J, O'Donnell BA, Lochhead AG. Orbital and periorbital microcystic adnexal carcinoma. Ophthal Plast Reconstr Surg. 2005;21:97-102.

Histologically it is infiltrative and poorly defined, presenting glandular and follicular differentiation. Cords and nests of squamous and basal cells of benign aspect as well as keratocysts are observed in the papillar and medium dermis. As it invades the reticular dermis it presents ductal structures similar to glands, covered by one to two layers of flat or cuboidal cells, with penetration of perineural spaces, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The stroma is dense, fibrous and of sclerotic appearance in infiltrative areas.77¬†Chiller K, Passaro D, Scheuller M, Singer M, McCalmont T, Grekin RC. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: forty-eight cases, their treatment, and their outcome. Arch Dermatol. 2000;136:1355-9.

Nests and ductal structures may present appendages similar to tadpole tails, seen in the syringoma and in the desmoplastic trichoepithelioma. Eccrine glandular differentiation is more common, but apocrine differentiation may also occur.77¬†Chiller K, Passaro D, Scheuller M, Singer M, McCalmont T, Grekin RC. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: forty-eight cases, their treatment, and their outcome. Arch Dermatol. 2000;136:1355-9.Cytologic atypia and mitoses are rare, being frequent in recurrent tumors, which is probably associated with a more aggressive biological behavior.88¬†Ongenae KC, Verhaegh ME, Vermeulen AH, Naeyaert JM. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: an uncommon tumor with debatable origin. Dermatol Surg. 2001;27:979-84.

The immunohistochemical pattern consists in the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and cytokeratin cocktail (AE1/AE3), sustaining follicular and eccrine differentiation. Backing the follicular differentiation, the tumor expresses hard cytokeratin (AE13 and AE14).77¬†Chiller K, Passaro D, Scheuller M, Singer M, McCalmont T, Grekin RC. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: forty-eight cases, their treatment, and their outcome. Arch Dermatol. 2000;136:1355-9.,88¬†Ongenae KC, Verhaegh ME, Vermeulen AH, Naeyaert JM. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: an uncommon tumor with debatable origin. Dermatol Surg. 2001;27:979-84.It presents a low proliferation index in immunolabeling with MIB.11¬†Goldstein DJ, Barr RJ, Santa Cruz DJ.

A reappraisal of the differentiation and differential diagnosis of an under recognized neoplasm. J Am Acad Dermatol. 1993;29:609-18.Occasionally there is immunoreactivity for hormone receptors, which requires thorough clinical investigation to exclude breast carcinoma.33¬†Rotter N, Wagner H, Fuchshuber S, Issing WJ. Cervical metastases of microcystic adnexal carcinoma in an otherwise healthy woman. Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. 2003;260:254-7.

Histopathological differential diagnosis includes trichoadenoma, syringoma, desmoplastic trichoepithelioma, sclerodermiform basal cell carcinoma, desmoplastic squamous cell carcinoma and metastatic breast carcinoma.77¬†Chiller K, Passaro D, Scheuller M, Singer M, McCalmont T, Grekin RC. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: forty-eight cases, their treatment, and their outcome. Arch Dermatol. 2000;136:1355-9.

The therapeutic modalities employed include radiotherapy, simple excision and Mohs micrographic surgery.44¬†Leibovitch I, Huilgol SC, Selva D, Lun K, Richards S, Paver R. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: treatment with Mohs micrographic surgery. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2005;52:295-300.

Long-term follow-up is recommended due to the elevated rates of recurrence. Overall survival is satisfactory. The majority of recurrences occur on average in the first 3 years, however there are reports of relapse in up to 30 years after surgery.1010¬†Yu JB, Blitzblau RC, Patel SC, Decker RH, Wilson LD. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database analysis of microcystic adnexal carcinoma (sclerosing sweat duct carcinoma) of the skin. Am J Clin Oncol. 2010;33:125-7.

In the case reported, the initial clinical hypothesis of scarring alopecia is justified by the locally aggressive biological behavior of MAC causing the destruction of pilosebaceous follicles and the dense fibrous stroma mimicking a scarring process, besides the uncommon topography. The inclusion of MAC in the differential clinical diagnosis of scarring alopecias is also suggested, in spite of being a remote possibility. We also emphasize the importance of a representative incisional biopsy covering the depth of the lesion, providing a correct initial diagnosis and consequently a less mutilating and definitive treatment, avoiding relapses.

AbstractKaposi sarcoma (KS) is a form of cancer that primarily appears on the skin but can potentially involve internal organs. There are several types of KS. The purpose of this article is to discuss the manifestations of KS and their appearance on imaging, the differential diagnoses associated with these findings, and molecular markers associated with KS that can aid appropriate diagnosis and therapy.

IntroductionKaposi sarcoma (KS) is a rare angioproliferative malignancy derived from the endothelium discovered by Hungarian dermatologist Moritz Kaposi in the late 1800s [1,2,3]. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) is the primary cause of KS, but its incidence is also influenced by genetics, the environment, and immunosuppression such as that experienced by patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or immunosuppressive drugs [2, 4]. Although the incidence of KS has been decreasing because of the efficacy of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for AIDS, KS is associated with patients that have had a solid organ transplant and are immunosuppressed and it is still prominent in Africa, partially due to the difficulty in accessing HAART [5].In resource-poor areas, diagnosis is often made upon observing the skin lesions, but this has specificity of approximately 80%. Biopsy, including image-guided may be performed to obtain a tissue diagnosis. Histologically, KS is seen as spindle-shaped cells interspersed with abnormal vascular channels [6]. Because of this, it is most commonly confused with vascular or spindle cell tumors; however, KS can be differentiated from these other tumors by the presence of HHV8, detected with the use of molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct in situ hybridization, in situ PCR, or reverse transcriptase in situ PCR [7]. HHV-8 (also called KSHV for Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) is the causative agent of KS [8] and although it can affect different cell types, endothelial cells are thought to be transformed in KS [9]. HHV8 can cause other diseases and is necessary but not sufficient to cause KS. HHV8 is latent in KS; yet some genes such as LNA-1 (latent nuclear antigen-1), a gene encoding cyclin D homologue (v-cyclin), and a FLIP protein homologue (v-FLIP) are strongly expressed and several signaling pathways are activated including the PI-3 kinase, MAPK, and mTOR pathway; however, the exact mechanism of cellular transformation is still under study.The various types of KS include classic KS, endemic KS, epidemic KS, and iatrogenic immunosuppressed KS [4]. The epidemiology of KS varies for each type; but in general, it is more commonly present in males and can occur in patients of any age [10]. The incidence of KS overall is 481.5 per 100,000 person-years (1.5 in HIV-negative general population, 655.1 in HIV-positive heterosexual men, 172 in women, 1397.1 in HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) among whom it is 180.7 with HAART vs 1271.9 without HAART, 52.9 in children with HIV infection, and 68.6 in transplant recipients per 100,000 person-years). KS frequently occurs in the skin (Fig.¬†1) and mucosa but can involve the viscera. Among KS types, visceral involvement is more common with the epidemic form and in this type occurs in approximately 15% of cases [11]. Radiologic imaging facilitates the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of KS. In this article, we discuss the presentation, imaging findings, and management of the various types of KS.Fig.¬†1Photograph showing solitary violaceous and dusky erythematous plaque of KS on the anterior trunk.

The type of variant can affect treatment approach; for example, in addition to other treatments, epidemic KS treatment can include HAART therapy and iatrogenic KS treatment can include reducing immunosuppression or altering the immunosuppressive agent.Classic Kaposi sarcomaThe classic variant of KS occurs primarily in older men, typically of Jewish descent, in the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe [5]. It can affect only visceral organs such as the liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen, lymph nodes, or the gastrointestinal (GI) tract without visible skin lesions; but, more commonly does also affect the skin in the lower parts of the body [12, 13]. Skin lesions can present as fungating growths or ulcerated lesions [13]. Treatment of classic KS includes surgery, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, and intralesional and systemic chemotherapy. However, most patients with classic KS have indolent, chronic disease and do not undergo treatment; rather, they undergo surveillance [14].The staging of classic KS is divided into four categories: In stage one, patients typically have nodules on their legs. In stage two, the lesions take on a plaque morphology primarily affecting large areas of the legs and are locally aggressive, defined as spreading quickly [13, 15]. Stage one and two can be broken down further into Group A, identified by slow disease progression, and Group B, identified by fast disease progression, defined as the quick growth of new or existing skin lesions. Stage three and four are associated with classic KS affecting the viscera and GI tract. In stage three, the lesions are localized to the limbs, whereas in stage four, there are disseminated lesions that also involve the trunk and head. Clinically, by stage three, with visceral involvement, organ damage can occur [13, 15].Endemic Kaposi sarcomaThe endemic KS (African KS) variant is most commonly found in Eastern and Central Africa [5]. Four types of endemic KS have been identified, including a benign nodular form, an aggressive localized form, a disseminated form, and a lymphadenopathic form [12]. Male and female children have an equal chance of receiving a diagnosis of endemic KS; but in adults, this variant is more commonly seen in men. It is characterized by small skin lesions in the lower half of the body that slowly become larger. Patients may have symptoms such as itching, burning, and chronic edema [16]. Lymphedema is often seen and can be difficult to control [9].A pediatric-specific staging classification has been proposed, known as the Lilongwe pediatric KS staging classification. Stage 1 includes those with mild KS, who show lesions on the skin and mouth. Patients classified with Stage 2 present with lymphadenopathic KS that tends to involve lymph node may present with the facial edema, nodular lesions in the mouth, or several lesions across the body among other signs. In Stage 3, known as Woody Edema KS, patients are separated into either 3A (edema‚Äâ<‚Äâ10% of the body) or 3B (edema‚Äâ>‚Äâ10% of the body). In Stage 4, patients have visceral or disseminated skin KS [17].Epidemic Kaposi sarcomaThe epidemic KS variant, also called HIV-related KS, is most commonly diagnosed in patients who test positive for HIV. Incidence of KS in the setting of HIV is related to the degree of immunosuppression, for example, KS incidence is 384.3 per 100,000 person-years with CD4 count‚Äâ>‚Äâ200 cells/ŒºL at baseline versus 2050.3 with CD4 count‚Äâ<‚Äâ200¬†cells/ŒºL [5]. KS is also one of the AIDS-defining malignancies. After the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the number of people in whom epidemic KS was diagnosed decreased significantly [18]. The efficacy of the HAART combination has been due to its lowering HIV replication and to its inhibition of inflammatory cytokines and HIV Tat protein production [19].Epidemic KS usually presents on the skin, the lining of the mouth, viscera (lungs, GI tract, etc.), or lymph nodes and can appear in more than one location [20]. The course of epidemic KS can differ greatly, with some patients having very limited involvement and others having much more [21]. Differential diagnoses include lymphoma, tuberculosis, Castleman‚Äôs disease, and widespread Mycobacterium avium complex. Generally, these other conditions are characterized by the appearance of lesions in lymph nodes [22] or viscera with little or no skin involvement. Visceral lesions such as in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract are most commonly seen with Epidemic KS [9].The staging system of epidemic KS was created by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) and takes into account tumor size, severity of systemic illness related to the HIV virus, and functionality of the patient‚Äôs immune system. The staging system is divided into a good risk and poor risk categories based on tumor, immune system, or systemic illness. For the tumor category, good risk is associated with confinement to the skin/lymph nodes, whereas poor risk is associated with visceral involvement. For the immune system category, good risk is associated with a CD4 cell count‚Äâ>‚Äâ200 per microliter, whereas poor risk is associated with a CD4 cell count‚Äâ<‚Äâ200 per microliter. For the systemic illness category, good risk is associated with an activity level‚Äâ>‚Äâ70 on the Karnofsky performance status scale, whereas poor risk is associated with‚Äâ<‚Äâ70 on the same scale [10]. This staging affects which treatments are chosen. A primary choice is HAART therapy which reduces HIV burden and immunosuppression. It may be used alone or jointly with other treatments, such as radiotherapy, intralesional chemotherapy, cryotherapy, chemotherapy, or interferon-Œ± [18].It has been suggested that there is a distinct epidemiologic form of KS in men who have sex with men without HIV infection [9]. Skin lesions may occur at any site but tend to be few and visceral or mucosal disease is rare. This usually has an indolent course [9].Iatrogenic Kaposi sarcomaThe iatrogenic KS variant can be seen in patients of any age who are immunosuppressed, including those who are taking immunosuppressants after undergoing organ transplantation or for other conditions [5]. Iatrogenic KS generally presents on the skin or in the mucosa, more commonly in lower parts of the body. Visceral involvement is possible in the disseminated form [2]. It is thought that immunosuppression reactivates the HHV8 virus [23]. Treatment for iatrogenic KS includes taking the patient off any immunosuppressant drugs that are not needed; other less common treatments may include wearing elastic stockings, intralesional vincristine, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, silver nitrate cauterization, and surgical excision [2].Imaging of Kaposi sarcomaImaging of thoracic Kaposi sarcomaIn the thorax, KS has the potential to appear in the lungs, pleura, or tracheobronchial tree. On CT scans, the four most common signs of intrathoracic KS include presence of a mass, nodules, thickening of the bronchovascular tree, and pleural effusions (Fig.¬†2) [24]. Other findings may include ground-glass opacities that may result in halo sign or flame-shaped lesions, round foci, dense interlobular septa, and lymphadenopathy; it is important to consider infection in the differential diagnosis [25]. Among these, pneumocystis pneumonia tends to have perihilar opacities, whereas KS is more commonly associated with infiltrates near blood vessels or near the bronchi [26]. KS pulmonary involvement can result in dyspnea, dry cough, sometimes fever, and hemoptysis that can be life-threatening [9]. Pulmonary Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma in patients with AIDS can portend a short three- to ten-month life-expectancy without effective anti-AIDS therapy [27].Fig.¬†229-year-old man with KS and HIV. Axial CT showing nodular opacities (short arrow) and ground-glass halos (long arrow) surrounding the bronchovascular bundles. Lymphadenopathy (short white arrow) and bilateral pleural effusions (arrowheads) are also notedFull size imageImaging of abdominal Kaposi sarcomaHepatic and splenic Kaposi sarcomaHepatic KS is most commonly seen among patients with AIDS, with about 34% of cases diagnosed during autopsy [28]; however, it uncommonly presents during life. Hepatic KS has also been associated with organ transplants [29].Hepatic KS appears differently on various imaging modalities [30]. A nonspecific finding associated with those who have hepatic KS and AIDS on several modalities is hepatomegaly [30]. KS often appears in the parenchyma near the hilar, portal, or capsular regions of the liver as low-attenuation nodules on CT (Fig.¬†3) that do not perturb the vessels; [31] but, they can also mimic hemangiomas. On MRI, KS often appears as high-signal nodules on in-phase T1-weighted images and low signal on out-of-phase images presumably due to intracellular fat, isointense on T2, and low signal on 20¬†min delayed images using a hepatobiliary MR contrast agent [31]. Differential diagnoses include angioma, liver metastases, and fungal microabscess [32]. Splenic KS is extremely rare, and on a microscopic level, it surrounds the arteries of the Malpighian corpuscles and has a stringy appearance. The differential diagnoses include hemangioma, metastasis, and fungal abscess among those who have AIDS [33]. Case reports of CT findings of splenic KS have described splenomegaly [33]. On ultrasound splenic and hepatic KS, lesions usually appear hyperechoic [33]. Histologically, identification of CD31 and CD34 can distinguish hepatic KS from nonvascular spindle cell tumors [28] and identification of HHV8 LNA-1 and D2-40 can help distinguish hepatic KS from vascular tumors [28].Fig.¬†348-year-old man with KS and HIV. Contrast-enhanced axial CT A‚ÄìB shows subcapsular low-attenuation lesions in the liver (arrows)Full size imageGastrointestinal Kaposi sarcomaAmong untreated AIDS patients, forty to fifty-one percent have visceral involvement of KS, with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract being the most common site [34]. AIDS-related KS more commonly involves the GI tract than the other forms of KS. Any portion of the GI tract may be involved from oropharynx to the rectum. Clinically, KS of the GI tract is most often asymptomatic, only one in five people have symptoms [34,35,36]. If symptoms are present, they may include hemorrhage, abdominal pain, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea [35, 36]. KS on the skin may suggest GI KS, which is more often noted in the stomach (Fig.¬†4), duodenum, and biliary tract [34, 37]. GI involvement may be seen as part of more widespread disease such as involving skin, GU system, skeleton, and third spacing of fluids (Fig.¬†4). Significant complications can include perforation, bleeding, and obstruction [38].Fig.¬†433-year-old male with HIV and KS. A Coronal contrast-enhanced CT showing antral wall thickening (fat white arrow), large and thick skin thickening (plaques, short white arrows), small skin nodules (small arrowheads), hydroceles (large arrowhead), subcutaneous edema (long arrow), and a pleural effusion (black arrow). B Axial contrast-enhanced CT showing asymmetric rectal wall thickening (white arrow), skin thickening (arrowheads), and subcutaneous edema (black arrows); C bone windows show lytic bone metastasesFull size imageOn CT imaging, diffuse or focal wall thickening (Fig.¬†4) may be seen and there may be associated ascites [34, 39]. Small lesions may present as polypoid or submucosal masses. CT images can also show splenomegaly and often enhancing lymphadenopathy in the mesentery, retroperitoneum, or elsewhere [40]. In gastric KS, particularly, one may see thickened folds, masses, and enhancing lymph nodes [41]. GI KS in the colon can be associated with abdominal cramps and diarrhea [42]. CT scans may show thickening of the colon and lymphadenopathy in the pelvis [42]. KS of the small bowel is uncommon and largely affects patients with HIV [43]. CT scans of a patient with rectal KS may demonstrate wall thickening (Figs.¬†4, 5), adenopathy, and inflammatory-like changes/fluid adjacent to the rectum [44]. CT can demonstrate improvement after therapy (Fig.¬†5). Lymphadenopathy can arise along the drainage pathways of visceral disease such as the pelvis and¬†groin in the case of rectal involvement, progress along drainage pathways of skin lesions (Fig.¬†6), or arise denovo. Differential diagnoses of GI KS include non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leiomyoma, GI stromal tumors, and adenocarcinoma [34, 35] as well as infection, polyps, and inflammatory conditions such as Crohn‚Äôs disease. However, uncomplicated KS lesions are less likely to have adjacent fat stranding. Clinical context is important. Because of the typically small tumors, endoscopy can be helpful [34] for detection, characterization, and biopsy for tissue diagnosis. Endoscopically, KS of the GI tract presents as red‚Äìpurple nodular lesions with little hemorrhage or as macular lesions with more severe hemorrhage [36]. Complications of larger lesions may include bleeding, intestinal or biliary obstruction, intussusception, perforation, diarrhea, and protein-losing enteropathy.Fig.¬†532-year-old male with HIV and KS.

Skin thickening in left gluteal region (arrowhead) is due to skin involvement by KS. Note: These images are of the same patient but from different yearsFull size imageGenitourinary Kaposi sarcomaIn men, within the genitourinary tract, KS is more commonly seen on the penis. In women, genital tract involvement is not commonly seen [45]. Lesions along the genital tract such as on the urethral meatus can sometimes lead to outlet obstruction and urinary retention [46]. Imaging studies are rarely needed for evaluation, but can show high T2-signal (Fig.¬†7), enhancing lesions on MR. KS affecting the scrotum is also extremely rare and very few cases have been recorded [47]; this can include skin involvement and complication such as hydroceles or fluid within the scrotum (Fig.¬†4). Renal involvement of KS in AIDS patients is not commonly observed at imaging; rather, it is more commonly found during autopsy due to its microscopic nature [48]. As with GI KS, associated lymphadenopathy tends to be hypervascular and manifests as enhancing nodes [49]. Differential considerations include Castleman‚Äôs disease, which can co-exist with KS. On contrast CT scans, KS lesions along the GU tract tend to enhance [50]. Differential diagnosis of classic KS on the penis includes pyogenic granuloma, condyloma acuminata, glomus tumor, and angiosarcomas [51]. In addition to antiretroviral therapy in the setting of HIV, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, laser therapy, and surgery represent treatment options [51].Fig.¬†752-year-old man with KS and HIV. MRI of pelvis. T2-weighted axial image showing hyperintense thickened soft tissue in glans penis (arrow)Full size imageImaging of cutaneous Kaposi‚Äôs sarcomaKS of the skin can appear virtually on any part of the body such as arms, legs, face, and neck and is normally present in all variants, especially in AIDS-related KS. There is a propensity for involvement of the lower extremities (Figs.¬†4, 6) and skin thickening may be seen by CT, MR, and ultrasound. Clinically, KS of the skin can appear in nodular, plaque, patch, lymphadenopathic, infiltrative, or florid forms and usually transitions through these phases as the lesions progress. Skin involvement without visceral involvement has a superior prognosis than with visceral involvement; imaging is more commonly performed to evaluate for whether there is visceral involvement (Fig.¬†4) [52]. MRI will generally allow for a more detailed evaluation of KS involvement [53] with lesions tending to enhance and have increased signal on T2-weighted imaging (Fig.¬†8).Fig.¬†8A A 67-year-old man with KS. MRI of left foot.

B A 45-year-old man with KS. MRI lower extremity T2 fat-saturated axial image with heterogeneously hyperintense subcutaneous tissue (short arrow) and a midline plantar nodule (long arrow), both of which are consistent with KSFull size imageImaging of Kaposi sarcoma using PET/CTUsing 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans can be useful in detecting KS, determining the extent of disease, and assessing which lesions are responding to treatment. On these scans, lesions present with low to moderately increased uptake (Fig.¬†9) [22] and there can be heterogeneity in uptake among tumors. 18F-FDG-PET/CT can be useful in diagnosing and staging cutaneous KS and associated lymph node involvement [54, 55]. Skin uptake can be focal or diffuse and is more commonly seen in the legs and lower torso. In addition, it can help distinguish visceral or skeletal involvement [56], which can portend a worse prognosis. KS is a widespread disease that can be occult and can affect essentially every organ; and 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans can be beneficial for whole-body staging [57] (Fig.¬†9) and evaluating response. In the transplant setting, it can suggest KS, for example with multi-lymph node involvement (Fig.¬†9), even in the uncommon circumstance of no cutaneous KS lesion [55].Fig.¬†931-year-old male with KS and history of immunosuppression for liver transplant secondary to biliary atresia. A PET showing 18F-FDG uptake in multi-compartment lymphadenopathy (arrows). B Coronal CT showing multicompartment lymphadenopathy in the abdomen and pelvis (arrows)Full size imageMolecular markersMolecular markers help distinguish KS from other diseases. Histologically, HHV8 expresses LANA-1, and its presence in KS cells indicates the presence of the virus. In addition, expression of viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6) by HHV8 has been associated with progression of KS. LANA-1 is present in more than 90% of patients with KS [7]. For classic KS, in particular, high levels of plasma markers CXCL10 (chemokine), sIL-1RII, sIL-2RA (protein), and CCL3 (chemokine) are associated with an increased risk of KS [58].Relationship of Kaposi sarcoma and HIVThe incidence of KS increased with the start of HIV infections in humans and the AIDS epidemic. Antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV were discovered starting in the late 1980s and eventually led to the combination HAART treatment. In 1987, azidothymidine (AZT) was made available to the public, and in 1991, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were introduced [59]. In 1995, protease inhibitors, such as ritonavir, were released [59, 60] and very likely contributed to the decline in KS incidence seen before 1996 (Fig.¬†10). After the combination HAART became available in 1996, the incidence of KS in patients with HIV decreased drastically due to effective treatment (Fig.¬†10) and in part due to AIDS prevention efforts; however, KS can still be found in patients with uncontrolled HIV infection or AIDS today and is still found in non-AIDS-related types of KS [61, 62]. Of note, although the incidence of AIDS and KS has significantly decreased, HIV infection rates were still increasing as of 2016.Fig.¬†10KS rate per 100,000 based on the SEER 9 Areas (San Francisco, Connecticut, Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Seattle, Utah, and Atlanta) age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population in relation to the HIV rate per 100,000 and the HIV/AIDS death rate per 100,000 in the USA [60,61,62]Full size imageConclusionKS is no longer as prevalent as it once was due to the successful introduction of HAART for AIDS. However, it is still found in such patients and in other KS variants such as in¬†iatrogenic immunosuppressed patients, for example related to organ transplants, as well as in classic and endemic forms. It can present with a myriad of manifestations reflected upon imaging of the abdomen and pelvis in addition to other parts of the body. Imaging using modalities such as CT, MRI, and PET/CT scans can aid in diagnosing, staging, and follow-up of KS.

        Abstract



BACKGROUND¬†
Limited information is available regarding survival outcomes and risk factors of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP).
OBJECTIVE¬†
To investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics and survival outcomes of DFSP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS¬†
The study cohort (7,567 patients) was selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (2000‚Äì2018). Demographic and clinicopathologic variables, survival outcomes, and prognostic factors were analyzed.
RESULTS¬†
A total of 5,640 (74.53%) and 1,927 (25.47%) tumors were located in the skin and soft tissue, respectively. The median follow-up duration was 92 months. Median follow-up times were similar between patients with lymph node (107 months) and distant (102 months) metastases; the median survival time of the 89 patients (1.18%) who died of DFSP was significantly short (41 months, p < .001). Independent risk factors for cancer-specific mortality included age at diagnosis, histologic grade, and tumor size. Patients with tumors ‚â•10 cm in size or histologic grade III had significantly higher DFSP-specific mortality (7.07% and 10.08%, respectively, p < .001). Tumor locations and surgical procedures did not significantly influence survival.
CONCLUSION¬†
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans has a favorable survival prognosis, even in patients with node-positive or distant metastases. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-specific mortality is significantly higher in patients with grade III or large (‚â•10 cm) tumors.


Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare, chronic, and locally aggressive cutaneous soft tissue sarcoma.1,2 Because of the low morbidity and mortality of DFSP, few previous studies have addressed risk factors influencing survival outcomes.3,4
Previous studies have demonstrated that tumor size is associated with metastasis and local recurrence.5 A retrospective analysis of 122 patients with DFSP found that there was a high possibility that cases with large tumors (‚â•10 cm) involved fibrosarcomatous transformation and had a high rate of metastasis.6 By analyzing the DFSP cases in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEERs) database, Maressa and colleagues4 revealed that tumor size was an independent risk factor for poor survival. Unfortunately, they did not perform subgroup analysis of patients based on tumor size. Although disease-free survival and recurrence were reported to be strongly predicted by tumor depth in the primary setting,7 very few studies have compared cutaneous DFSP and DFSP with soft tissue involvement,8,9 and the relationship between tumor depth and survival has not yet been explored.
Most DFSPs are intermediate-grade tumors. Some DFSPs transform to high-grade tumors in a process called fibrosarcomatous transformation.10 According to limited retrospective data, the risk of metastasis and death in DFSP-fibrosarcomatous transformation is higher than that in DFSP.11 Nevertheless, the sample size of the relevant studies was small, and their survival data were insufficient. Studies with larger sample sizes and complete follow-up data are required to validate these findings.
Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for DFSP.12 Margin status is an important prognostic factor for DFSP recurrence and disease-free survival after treatment.6 Wide local excision and Mohs micrographic surgery can achieve negative margins, resulting in ideal local control.12‚Äì14 The relationship between the surgical approach and DFSP-specific survival remains controversial. Some studies have found that negative margins lead to prolonged survival, whereas others have indicated no direct relationship between surgical margins and DFSP‚Äêspecific mortality.4
In this study, we used population-based data to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics and survival outcomes of DFSP, focusing on the risk factors associated with survival. We then explored tumor properties in patients who died of DFSP.
Materials and Methods
Patient Selection
The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital in China. We obtained data from the SEER Registry from 2000 to 2018, which included 18 regions. The cancer incidence and mortality data published by SEER-18 represent approximately 30% of the US population. The SEER database is freely available and has patient anonymization; written informed consent was not required.
The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-O-3 histologic codes of ‚Äú8832/3: Dermatofibrosarcoma, NOS,‚Äù ‚Äú8833/3: Pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor),‚Äù and the topographical codes of ‚ÄúC44: Skin‚Äù or ‚ÄúC49: Connective, subcutaneous and other soft tissues‚Äù were included. Skin DFSP was defined as a tumor located at ‚ÄúC44: Skin,‚Äù and soft tissue DFSP was described as a tumor located at ‚ÄúC49: Connective, subcutaneous, and other soft tissues‚Äù (including adipose tissue, aponeuroses, artery, blood vessel, bursa, connective tissue, fascia, fatty tissue, fibrous tissue, ligament, lymphatic, muscle, skeletal muscle, subcutaneous tissue, synovia, tendon, tendon sheath, vein, and vessel).
Tumor Characteristics
We evaluated independent demographic and clinicopathologic variables for each case, including age at diagnosis, sex (female, male), year of diagnosis, tumor location (skin, soft tissue), anatomic site (head/neck, trunk, extremities), histologic grade (grades I, II, III), tumor size, N stage (N0, N1), M stage (M0, M1), type of surgery (local destruction/excision, gross/radical excision, no surgery), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.
In the SEER database, the histologic grade was encoded on the basis of grade codes in the ICD-O-3 or earlier versions. However, the most widely used system for soft tissue sarcomas is the French F√©d√©ration National de Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer grading system, upon which we adapted the histologic grade to establish 3 levels by merging ‚Äúpoorly differentiated‚Äù and ‚Äúundifferentiated.‚Äù
We reclassified the surgical procedures according to surgical margins. Local destruction/excision refers to procedures performed with a positive surgical margin, whereas gross/radical excision refers to procedures performed with a negative surgical margin. For patients with DFSP in the skin, local destruction/excision included photodynamic therapy, cryosurgery, laser therapy, and excisional biopsy. In contrast, gross/radical excision included gross excision, Mohs surgery, wide excision with margins of more than 1 cm, and amputation. For patients with DFSP in the soft tissue, local destruction/excision included local tumor destruction, local excision, and partial resection. In contrast, gross/radical excision included radical excision or resection of the lesion with limb salvage and amputation.
Survival Analysis
Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival were calculated from the date of diagnosis to the last date of available vital status data. Multivariable Cox regression models with backward elimination were used to identify the most critical factors associated with OS and cancer-specific survival. Significant factors determined by the univariate Cox model were used as explanatory variables in the multivariate Cox regression models. The model for DFSP included age, sex, anatomic site, histologic grade, tumor size, N stage, M stage, type of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.
Comparative Analysis of DFSP_ Skin and DFSP_ Soft Tissue
According to the topographic codes, all patients were divided into 2 groups: DFSP_Skin (ICD-O-3: code C44) and DFSP_Soft Tissue (ICD-O-3: code C49). Independent demographic and clinicopathologic variables were compared between the 2 groups.
The Kaplan‚ÄìMeier method was used to estimate OS and cancer-specific survival, and the log-rank test was used to compare the 2 groups. Propensity-score matching (exact match, match tolerance = 0) was performed to further evaluate the difference in survival between the 2 groups after adjusting for age, year of diagnosis, anatomic site, histologic grade, tumor size, N stage, M stage, type of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were compared using Student t test or analysis of variance. Categorical variables were compared using Pearson chi-square test or rank-sum test. Survival curves were obtained using the Kaplan‚ÄìMeier method and compared using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were constructed to analyze factors associated with survival.
Statistical significance was set at a 2-sided p < .05. All confidence intervals were stated at the 95% confidence level. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 25.0; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) and Stata statistical software (version 17.0; StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX).
Results
In total, 7,567 patients with histologically confirmed DFSP were included in this study. Tumors in most patients were categorized as ‚Äú8832/3: Dermatofibrosarcoma, NOS,‚Äù whereas ‚Äú8833/3: Pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor)‚Äù accounted for only 2.75%. According to the ICD-O-3 topographical code, 74.53% of the cases were coded as ‚ÄúC44: Skin,‚Äù and 25.47% were coded as ‚ÄúC49: Connective, subcutaneous, and other soft tissues.‚Äù
The demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients with DFSP were summarized in Table 1. The median age at diagnosis was 42 years (range: 0‚Äì99 years). Only 764 patients had histologic grade records, with 45.81%, 38.61%, and 15.58% rated as grade I, II, and III tumors, respectively. Approximately half of the patients had tumor size records (median: 30 mm, range: 1‚Äì221 mm). At diagnosis, 0.17% of the patients had lymph node metastases, and 0.54% had distant metastases. Surgery was the primary treatment for DFSP, even for patients with distant metastases. More than half of the cases underwent gross/radical excision, and approximately one-third underwent local destruction/excision. Only 1.06% and 5.75% of the patients received chemotherapy and radiotherapy, respectively.

Survival and Predictors of Survival
The median follow-up duration was 92 months for all patients with DFSP. The 10- and 15-year OS rates were 90.7% and 85.7%, respectively. The 10- and 15-year DFSP-specific survival rates were 98.5% and 98.0%, respectively. Only 89 patients died of DFSP. The median survival time in cases of mortality was 41 months (range: 1‚Äì218 months); these cases had significantly larger tumors (median tumor size: 63 vs 30 mm, p < .001), more grade III tumors (54.6% vs 15.6%, p < .001), and a higher proportion of males (62.9% vs 47.0%, p = .003).
Fifty-four of the 7,567 DFSP patients had lymph node metastases (13, 0.17%) or distant metastases (41, 0.54%) at diagnosis, and only 3 died because of DFSP. The median follow-up period was 107 months for node-positive patients and 102 months for patients with distant metastases; both periods were similar to that of the overall population (92 months). Only 6 patients with lymph node or distant metastases had histologic grade records. The relationship between metastasis and histologic grade remained unclear.
Significant factors in the univariate survival analysis (See Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table 1, https://links.lww.com/DSS/B291) were used as explanatory variables in multivariate Cox regression models. The model for OS included age at diagnosis, sex, histologic grade, tumor size, and chemotherapy. For cancer-specific mortality, the factors in the model were age at diagnosis, histologic grade, and tumor size (Table 2). Tumor location (skin or soft tissue) and surgery were not independent risk factors for OS and cancer-specific survival.

Survival Comparison of the DFSP_Skin and DFSP_Soft Tissue Groups
According to the topographical codes in ICD-O-3, 5,640 (74.53%) tumors were located in the skin, and 1,927 (25.47%) were in the soft tissue. Tumor size was significantly larger in the DFSP_Soft Tissue group (median: 36 vs 30 mm, p < .001), whereas the intergroup differences in the other variables were not significant (See Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table 2, https://links.lww.com/DSS/B291). Kaplan‚ÄìMeier analyses demonstrated a slightly worse prognosis in the DFSP_Soft Tissue group (OS: p = .051, cancer-specific survival: p = .038) (See Supplemental Digital Content 1, Figure 1, https://links.lww.com/DSS/B291). However, after propensity-score matching with adjustment for critical factors (See Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table 3, https://links.lww.com/DSS/B291), the survival outcomes of the 2 groups tended to be equivalent (See Supplemental Digital Content 1, Figure 1, https://links.lww.com/DSS/B291).
Effect of Histologic Grade on the Survival Prognosis of Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans
Histologic grade records were available for only 763 patients (10.10%). Kaplan‚ÄìMeier curves indicated that OS and cancer-specific survival of patients in the grade III group were significantly worse than those in the other 2 groups (p < .001, Figure 1A,B). The DFSP-specific mortality of patients in the grade III group was 10.08% (12/107), which was considerably higher than the grade I (1.14%) and grade II groups (2.03%) (p < .001).Figure 1.: Kaplan‚ÄìMeier curves of survival according to tumor grade and tumor size. (A and B) survival of the Grade III group patients was significantly worse than the other 2 groups. (C) The overall survival of the patients gradually decreased as the diameter of the tumor increased. (D) When the tumor was smaller than 10 cm, the effect of tumor size on DFSP-specific survival was insignificant. DFSP, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.Effect of Tumor Size on the Survival Prognosis of Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans
To further analyze the effect of tumor size on survival, all patients were divided into 4 groups (0‚Äì2, 2‚Äì5, 5‚Äì10, and >10 cm). Kaplan‚ÄìMeier survival estimation and log-rank tests showed that patients with larger tumors had a significantly worse prognosis, especially when the tumor size exceeded 10 cm (p < .001) (Figure 1C,D). Among the 184 patients with tumors >10 cm, 13 (7.07%) died of DFSP. The mortality rate was significantly higher compared with the other groups (p < .001).
Effect of Surgical Methods on the Survival Prognosis of Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans
For all DFSP patients, only the type of surgery influenced OS, with a better prognosis in the gross/radical excision group (p < .001) (See Supplemental Digital Content 1, Figure 2, https://links.lww.com/DSS/B291). Notably, patients with DFSP in the skin underwent significantly more gross/radical excision than patients with DFSP in soft tissue (64.89% vs 30.83%, p < .001) (See Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table 3, https://links.lww.com/DSS/B291). The effect of surgical method on cancer-specific survival was insignificant in the DFSP_Skin and DFSP_Soft Tissue groups.
For DFSP_Skin, 3 types of radical surgery were performed: gross excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, and wide excision. Patients who underwent Mohs micrographic surgery had a better OS prognosis (p = .005). No significant difference was noticed in cancer-specific survival (p = .468) (See Supplemental Digital Content 1, Figure 3, https://links.lww.com/DSS/B291).
Discussion
Using a population-based observational cohort of SEER data, we measured the survival outcomes of 7,567 patients with DFSP. This is the first study to include skin and soft tissue DFSP. Our comparison of independent demographic and clinicopathologic variables between DFSP_Skin and DFSP_Soft Tissue indicated no significant differences, except for tumor size. The reason may be that DFSP is more insidious in soft tissues, which resulted in a delayed diagnosis. Our univariate survival analysis demonstrated that patient survival in the DFSP_Soft Tissue group was worse than that in the DFSP_Skin group. The multivariate analysis after propensity-score matching demonstrated no significant difference between the 2 groups. Therefore, tumor depth may not be an independent risk factor for survival prognosis in DFSP.
Although DFSP has a relatively high local recurrence rate, with few cases exhibiting distant metastasis, it has little effect on patient survival.4,11 In this study, only 89 (1.8%) patients died of DFSP. However, the median survival time of these patients was only 41 months. The median follow-up time was 107 months for node-positive patients and 102 months for patients with distant metastases, both of which were similar to the overall population. Previous studies have reported contradictory results, and the reasons remain unclear.15
Multiple studies have shown that tumor size is a significant risk factor for survival.5,6,11 In this study, survival analysis confirmed that tumor size was an independent risk factor for survival. In particular, when the tumor size exceeded 10 cm, the survival prognosis of patients with DFSP was significantly worse. In total, 184 patients had tumors >10 cm, 13 of whom died of DFSP. The mortality rate of 7.07% was much higher than that in the other groups.
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is usually considered a low-grade malignancy, but 10% to 20% of tumors present with high-grade histologic transformation15,16 associated with local recurrence and distant metastasis.5 In this study, we found that the histologic grade was an independent risk factor for survival in patients with DFSP. Nevertheless, only patients with grade III tumors had a significantly poorer prognosis, whereas the difference between grades I and II was insignificant. The DFSP-specific mortality rate of patients with grade III tumors was 10.08% (12/107), which was considerably higher than that of patients with grade I and II tumors.
Surgery is the primary treatment modality for DFSP, and radical resection directly determines local recurrence.13 Our results revealed that patients in the DFSP_Skin group underwent significantly more radical resections than those in the DFSP_Soft Tissue group. This finding may be related to the superficial tumor site in the skin group, which facilitated radical resection. Surgery only affected OS, regardless of the tumor location. Moreover, multivariate Cox analysis indicated that for OS and DFSP-specific survival, the type of surgery was not an independent risk factor. In recent years, Mohs surgery has shown the advantages of local control of skin DFSP14,17 and has also demonstrated some benefits in OS for skin DFSP. The effect of Mohs surgery on DFSP-specific survival was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, we believe that the role of Mohs surgery in DFSP-specific survival warrants further study.
Overall, our study confirmed that DFSP is a low-grade tumor with a good prognosis and survival rate, even in patients with node-positive or distant metastases. The risk of death was significantly greater in some exceptional cases, such as tumors with histologic grade III or a size larger than 10 cm. Previous studies reported that the risk of metastasis and death in DFSP‚Äìfibrosarcomatous transformation was higher than in DFSP. Fibrosarcomatous transformation is defined as a tumor that has monotonously fusiform cells with the following characteristics: enlarged atypical nuclei, cytologic atypia, a high mitotic count, and CD34 negative. Cytologic atypia and a high mitotic count are also essential for the grade III classification in the French F√©d√©ration National de Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer and World Health Organization grading systems. We suspected that the nature of the grade III tumors had changed and fibrosarcomatous transformation may be the underlying cause of a poorer prognosis.15 Conventional treatments, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, are ineffective in improving the survival of these patients. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib have been shown to be effective for locally advanced and unresectable DFSP.18,19 Targeted drugs may improve survival in the future. Unfortunately, there is insufficient information in the SEER database for fibrosarcomatous transformation identification, and there are no records of targeted therapy.
This study had some limitations. First, the DFSP-specific mortality rate was considerably low, and the survival analysis may not have been sufficiently precise. Second, because the study cohort included only a few cases of lymph node or distant metastases, the association with DFSP-related deaths requires further exploration. Finally, this study only analyzed the survival prognosis of DFSP, which limited the clinical applicability of the results.
Conclusion
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans demonstrated a favorable survival prognosis, even in patients with node-positive or distant metastases. However, patients who died because of DFSP did not survive long after disease onset. The histologic grade and tumor size directly affected the survival of patients. In particular, DFSP-specific mortality was significantly higher in patients with grade III tumors or tumors ‚â•10 cm in size.References

AbstractBackgroundDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) of the breast is a dermal fibroblastic neoplasm requiring wide excisional margins due to recurrence rates ranging from 26 to 60%. The current literature on reconstructive options and utility of Mohs micrographic surgery for DFSP of the breast is scarce. We describe surgical management of DFSP of the breast at our institution with the largest case series reported to date.MethodsA retrospective review was performed of women who underwent surgery for DFSP of the breast at our institution between 1990 and 2019. Continuous data was summarized using mean, median, and range; categorical data was summarized with frequency count and percentage. Preoperative lesion size and postoperative defect size were evaluated using 2-sided Fisher exact test, and p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsNine patients underwent wide local excision (WLE) with reconstruction including pedicled latissimus dorsi flaps (n = 2), local flap advancement (n = 2), mastectomy with implant (n = 1), oncoplastic breast reduction (n = 1), and skin grafts (n = 3). Nine underwent Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) with complex primary closure. Mean postoperative maximum wound defect size for WLE was 10.8 cm versus 7.0 cm for MMS with no statistical significance (p = 0.77). Mean preoperative maximum lesion size for WLE was 6.4 cm versus 3.3 cm for MMS with no statistical significance (p = 0.07). Complications with WLE included wound dehiscence in three patients and seroma in one patient. No complications were reported with MMS and primary closure. Recurrence was reported in one WLE patient, which was successfully detected despite flap coverage and resected without complications. Median follow-up for the patients without recurrence was 5.0 years, with two patients in MMS cohort lost to follow-up. Five-year overall survival was 100%.ConclusionsMMS and WLE are both viable surgical options for managing DFSP of the breast. MMS could potentially minimize reconstructive needs due to smaller average defect size and result in fewer complications but may also result in asymmetry. Immediate flap reconstruction, especially in larger defects, can achieve excellent aesthetic outcomes for patients with DFSP of the breast without compromising detection of disease recurrence.
BackgroundDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare neoplasm of dermal fibroblastic origin that comprises 1% of all soft tissue sarcomas [1]. It most frequently appears on the trunk and extremities but can also involve the breast [2]. Most patients are diagnosed between the 2nd and 4th decades of life [2]. Due to its appearance and slow growth often over many years, it is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as a cyst, dermatofibroma, or keloid [3]. Although it has a low incidence of metastasis and 5-year survival rate approaching 100%, it is locally aggressive with a recurrence rate of 0‚Äì30% with wide local excision (WLE) and 26‚Äì60% recurrence rate with narrow or positive margins [4-6]. This presents a challenge for balancing local control and cosmesis.Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the treatment of DFSP recommend WLE with 2‚Äì4-cm gross margins or Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) [7]. In the case of WLE, large defects can result following resection due to large margins, often requiring reconstructive procedures with flaps or skin grafts for coverage [6]. An additional challenge is balancing adequate resection for margin control and the aesthetic goals of symmetry, especially with breast lesions. The present literature on DFSP of the breast is scarce, with single institution case series describing 1‚Äì6 patients resected by WLE [8]. Although there are no established guidelines for breast reconstruction following DFSP resection, one case report of reconstruction following WLE recommended delaying reconstruction at least 2 years as it may prevent detection of local recurrence and will result in better aesthetic outcomes [3]. The aim of our study is to describe the surgical management, reconstructive procedures, and postoperative outcomes of 18 patients with DFSP of the breast resected by WLE and MMS at Mayo Clinic. We present the largest case series to date at a single institution.Materials and methodsOur study was exempt from Mayo Clinic IRB. We performed a retrospective review of medical records including women who were diagnosed with DFSP of the breast with a positive CD34 immunostain on biopsy. These patients underwent surgical resection and reconstruction at our institution between May 1990 and May 2020. We retrieved data such as sociodemographic variables, tumor location, type of resection, size of margins, recurrences, duration of follow-up, preoperative lesion size, postoperative defect size, type of closure or coverage, comorbidities, and possible complications such as partial or full flap necrosis, seroma, hematoma, dehiscence, or surgical revision. Continuous data was summarized using mean (standard deviation), median, and range; categorical data was summarized with frequency count and percentage. A lesion of the breast was defined as within the borders of the clavicle, midaxillary line, and inframammary fold. Preoperative lesion size and postoperative defect size were evaluated using 2-sided Fisher exact test, and p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The duration of follow-up was defined as date of tumor excision through date of last breast exam.ResultsClinical characteristicsBetween 1990 and 2020, a total of 18 women with DFSP of the breast were treated surgically at our institution. The average age at the time of surgery was 39.8 years (range 23‚Äì70), with a demographic composition of 72% (13/18) White, 11% (2/18) Arab, 11% (2/18) Hispanic, and 6% (1/18) Chinese. Most patients presented with concern for an enlarging unilateral lesion which varied from 1.5 to 6 cm on physical exam. Two patients had suspicious keloidal scars 12 cm in length. Six patients had a lesion in the upper outer quadrant, six patients in the upper inner quadrant, and six patients in the lower inner quadrant. Provisional diagnoses prior to excisional biopsy included epidermal inclusion cyst, sebaceous cyst, keloidal scar, myxoid neurofibroma, supernumerary nipple, and dermatofibrosarcoma. With provisional diagnosis in mind, 17/18 patients had an excisional biopsy and were diagnosed with DFSP by positive immunohistochemistry stain for CD34. Patients were then referred to our institution for definitive management as pathology showed either positive margins or incomplete resection of DFSP. One patient had prior recurrence of DFSP and underwent resection without preoperative biopsy. Two patients in the MMS cohort were lost to follow-up, and their missing data such as recurrence and complications were excluded from analysis.Treatment characteristicsOf the 18 women, 9 had DFSP resected by wide local excision (WLE) with margins determined by intraoperative pathologic frozen section analysis (Table 1). Nine patients were treated with Mohs surgery followed by complex primary closure (Table 2). Reconstruction for patients who underwent WLE included the following: latissimus dorsi flaps (n = 2), local flap advancement (n = 2), mastectomy with implant (n = 1), oncoplastic breast reduction (n = 1), and split-thickness skin grafts (n = 3). Three patients with flap and implant reconstruction had prior breast surgery including bilateral reduction mammoplasty, bilateral prepectoral silicone implants, and prior excision of DFSP with transverse rectus abdominis muscle flap (TRAM) reconstruction. Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 illustrate the aesthetic results of MMS with primary closure and WLE with flap or skin graft coverage of varying lesion sizes in different breast quadrants.Table 1 Patient characteristics for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans breast lesions treated by WLEFull size tableTable 2 Patient characteristics for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans breast lesions treated by MMS and primary closureFull size tableFig. 1A DFSP lesion size of 6.8 cm in lower inner quadrant.

B Postoperative result of 12-cm lesion in upper outer quadrant treated by WLE and coverage with skin graft after 4 yearsFull size imageAll flap reconstructions were performed the same day or within 2 days of WLE, and average microscopic closest margin for WLE cases was 1.1 cm (SD = 0.4). Gross intended margins available for 4/9 patients ranged from 1 to 3 cm. Six out of nine patients in the WLE cohort had intraoperative re-excision following positive margins on initial intraoperative pathology from skin-sparing mastectomy. Mean postoperative maximum wound defect size for WLE was 10.8 cm (range = 7.2‚Äì17 cm, SD = 3.7) with one patient undergoing skin-sparing mastectomy, while mean postoperative maximum wound defect size for MMS was 7.0 cm (range = 2.2‚Äì12, SD = 3.3) as shown in Table 3. Mean preoperative maximum lesion size for WLE was 6.4 cm (range = 1.8‚Äì12, SD = 3.7) and for MMS was 3.3 cm (range = 0.9‚Äì6.8 cm, SD = 1.8). There was no statistical significance in preoperative lesion size (p = 0.07) or postoperative defect size (p = 0.77) between MMS and WLE. One patient with prior history of DFSP recurrence who was reconstructed with a latissimus dorsi flap underwent 66 Gy of radiation postoperatively. No other patients received preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy or radiation.Table 3 Comparing mean preoperative lesion size and postoperative defect size between MMS and WLEFull size tableIn terms of complications, two of three patients with skin grafts had recipient site superficial wound dehiscence managed nonoperatively with dressings. The patient with two-stage implant reconstruction had recipient site full-thickness wound dehiscence requiring surgical intervention. One patient with local flap advancement had seroma formation requiring drainage. No complications were reported in the 7 patients with follow-up in the MMS cohort.Recurrence and follow-upLocal recurrence was reported in one patient treated with WLE (1/9) and flap at 6 months following surgery versus none in MMS cohort (0/7). This was resected with WLE and intraoperative frozen sectioning without complications. This patient also developed pulmonary metastases detected on CT scan at 9 months following excision of local recurrence. They were resected with no further recurrence of DFSP. Three patients reconstructed with a flap or implant underwent at least one revision surgery for redundant skin, contour abnormalities, or implant exchange. The median follow-up time was 5.0 years (Q1‚Äì3: 3.5‚Äì11.3), not including two patients who underwent MMS and lost to follow-up. Five-year overall survival was 100% for the 16 patients with follow-up.DiscussionWe present a series of 18 patients with DFSP of the breast who underwent either MMS or WLE with either reconstructive surgery or primary closure. Our study showed a difference in lesion size of 3.3 cm in MMS versus 6.4 cm in WLE as well as excised specimen size of 7.0 cm in MMS compared with 10.8 cm in WLE. However, neither of these were statistically significant likely due to the small sample size. Although gross intended margins ranged from 1 to 3 cm with WLE in our series, about 67% (6/9) of patients with WLE had at least one intraoperative re-excision following positive margins on initial intraoperative pathology, indicating that the intended margins in these cases were not wide enough. Most DFSP recurrences are detected within 3 years of primary excision. Our study, with a median follow-up of 5 years, identified one patient with recurrence in the WLE cohort, but no recurrences with MMS [1]. Compared to primary closure, there was increased morbidity with more complex reconstructions, including flaps and grafts, but no surgical complications were observed in our two patients with pedicled flap coverage.The major difference between MMS and WLE is the extent of resection of normal tissue and margin control [9]. A retrospective review of 48 patients with DFSP demonstrated more frequent positive margins in WLE than MMS, suggesting that MMS allows more focused resection resulting in accurate margin control [10]. Pathologic analysis of WLE specimens typically utilizes a vertical ‚Äúbreadloafing‚Äù technique, which can result in sampling error if the intervals of the sections miss extensions of tumor especially with DFSP‚Äôs infiltrative and asymmetric growth [9]. Most studies and systematic reviews report a lower recurrence rate with MMS compared to WLE [6, 11-20]. Similarly, studies utilizing modified WLE with total peripheral margin analysis and horizontal processing were able to achieve 0‚Äì1% recurrence rates, suggesting that meticulous margin evaluation is important regardless of surgical technique [5, 17, 21]. By focused excision of margins as directed by frozen section histologic review, MMS can also limit the size of postoperative defect compared to WLE [6, 7, 19, 22, 23]. Lowe et al. found a statistically significant smaller postoperative defect size by 2 cm in MMS compared to WLE in treatment of DFSP [6]. Goldberg et al. also found no recurrence in MMS despite MMS having average margin size of 1.36 cm compared to 2.33 cm for WLE [16]. This may be a deciding factor when resecting DFSP from a cosmetically sensitive area such as the breast, head, or neck [10, 21]. Similar to our study, there is also a trend of smaller lesions being more likely to be treated by MMS and larger lesions treated by WLE as DuBay et al., for example, reported in their study that preoperative lesions averaging 5.3 cm2 were treated by MMS, while preoperative lesions averaging 14.8 cm2 were treated by WLE [21].All of our patients had unilateral DFSP of the breast, which can cause visible asymmetry following resection. There is clearly a size limit that will allow acceptable symmetry following primary closure with MMS, and this is also dependent on tumor location and breast size. For example, Fig. 1b shows loss of inferior pole with MMS and primary closure in a patient with a 6.8-cm lesion in the lower inner quadrant near the inframammary fold. Figure 2b demonstrates an excellent cosmetic result with MMS for a 2.7-cm lesion in the upper inner quadrant where there is less breast tissue. The use of a pedicled latissimus dorsi flap can preserve lower pole fullness and symmetry as seen in Fig. 3a and b, following resection of a 3.5-cm mass. MMS may be beneficial for patients who have a smaller lesion to breast size or location with less breast tissue, allowing for an aesthetically pleasing result with primary closure without further revision [24].Interestingly for DFSP of the breast, there are no case reports that describe use of MMS for resection, very few case reports that describe reconstruction and its complications following resection, and no studies that compare complications between primary closure and reconstruction [8]. In addition to primary closure, reconstruction techniques cited in the literature include pedicled latissimus dorsi flap, rotation flap, reverse abdominoplasty, pectoralis flap, and reduction mammoplasty to provide wound coverage and to preserve breast shape [25-30]. We found no complications in our MMS and primary closure cohort but encountered complications requiring intervention with WLE and skin grafts, implant, and rotational flap reconstructions. One recurrence in the WLE cohort was detected despite pedicled flap reconstruction and resected without complications. Despite potential asymmetry, there still may be value to primary closure after MMS in select patients as it involves fewer complications, allows for time to monitor the wound for possible recurrence, and provides the patient more time to decide whether a simple repair is sufficient or a more complex delayed revision is desired. Although our flap reconstructions were immediate due to availability of intraoperative frozen sectioning, this may not translate to other institutions where frozen section is not available. All of these considerations should be discussed in shared decision-making with the patient when selecting among WLE, MMS, and timing of reconstruction.A limitation of our retrospective study is likely selection bias in which patients were referred for WLE or MMS. Potentially, patients with larger tumors, smaller breast size, and/or those who voiced concern over cosmetics were referred to a plastic surgeon. There can be confounding factors such as surgeon preference or if patients were offered a plastic surgery consult to discuss possible elective reconstruction. Another limitation is we did not collect patient-reported outcomes, and thus, it is unknown if patients were satisfied with the aesthetic outcomes of the different techniques.ConclusionThis study is the largest case series of DFSP of the breast and describes two cohorts of patients managed by different resection modalities, reconstructions, and outcomes, which has been missing from the literature. Both MMS and WLE are viable options for resection, and we cannot conclude if one is superior. With either method, meticulous surgical margins and histologic analysis are important to minimize recurrence and allow for immediate reconstruction when required. Characteristics such as preoperative lesion size, postoperative defect size, and soft tissue availability can help determine if a simpler repair with MMS would be beneficial or a more complex staged reconstruction with WLE is preferred. Shared decision-making with the patient should also play a role in determining immediate reconstruction with WLE, primary closure with MMS, or staged delayed reconstruction with MMS.

AbstractA 43-year-old woman presented with an 8-week history of fatigue and recurrent right sided nasal bleeds progressing to significant pain and swelling on the right side of her face. Clinical examination revealed a friable mass in her right nasal passage. A biopsy and staging positron emission tomography-CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of a T4 N1 M1 BRAF wild type mucosal melanoma. The melanoma had metastasised to the right paranasal sinuses, right and left neck nodes, right submental node, right upper breast, liver, the subcutaneous fat of the left buttock and the right iliac bone as well as cerebral metastasis with further disease progression. Combination immunotherapy was started but initially suspended due to an adverse reaction to nivolumab and restarted in due course. Surgical debulking was carried out for symptomatic relief. This case report explores the delay in diagnosis of mucosal melanoma with its subsequent consequences and the lack of understanding of associated risk factors and optimal treatment.dermatologyoncologyhead and neck cancerear, nose and throat/otolaryngology

AbstractBackgroundA cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare malignant tumour of vascular endothelial cells with aggressive clinical behaviour and poor prognosis. Diagnosis is often delayed due to its variable and often benign clinical appearance.Case presentationThis case presents a 64-year-old man with a six-month-history of a recurrent diffuse and erythematous painless swelling below the left eye. Several resections with intraoperatively negative resection margins followed, but positive margins were repeatedly detected later on permanent sections. Histopathologic examination of the specimen diagnosed a cutaneous angiosarcoma. Neither, finally achieved negative margins on permanent sections, nor a following chemotherapy could prevent the recurrence of the disease after five months and the patient's dead 21 months after the first diagnosis.ConclusionThe case elucidates the current diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma of this entity, which shows an unfavourable clinical course in spite of multimodal therapy.


Peer Review reports

BackgroundA cutaneous angiosarcoma (synonyms: lymphangiosarcoma and haemangiosarcoma) is a rare malignant tumour of vascular endothelial cells. It occurs predominantly in the elderly and is confined to the face and the scalp region in more than 50% of cases [1]. Despite the aggressive behaviour and poor prognosis, the diagnosis is often delayed due to its variable and often benign clinical appearance. This case documents a facial cutaneous angiosarcoma in an elderly male patient, revealing the diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma of this entity, which shows an unfavourable clinical course in spite of multimodal therapy.Case reportA 64-year-old man presented with a six month history of a recurrent diffuse and erythematous painless swelling (3 √ó 2 cm2) below the left eye to the Department of Dermatology, Regensburg University, Germany. Cervical lymphadenopathy was clinically not detectable. Routine laboratory results showed no abnormality. Presuming an allergic dermatitis, topical treatment with steroids was initiated. Because of the persistence of the lesion, an incisional biopsy was performed three weeks later (Figure 1). Histopathology of the specimen showed an invasively growing tumour of the dermis, composed of atypical vascular endothelia in a disordered manner, forming bizarre vascular lumina. The tumor cells were characterized by an elevated proliferated activity with a proliferation fraction (MIB-1) of 5%‚Äì10%. The vascular endothelial proliferation showed a papillary architecture accompanied by small lymphocytes. The majority of endothelial cells presented a hyperchromatic nucleus and a swollen cytoplasm. (Figure 2a, 2b, 2c). Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated positivity for CD 31 (Figure 2d) and factor VIII-related antigen. Based on these findings the diagnosis of a cutaneous angiosarcoma was made.Figure 1

After referral of the patient to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Regensburg University, Germany, the tumour was removed by wide local surgical excision (Figure 3) and the defect was temporarily covered by Epigard. Despite negative intraoperative frozen section margins, positive margins were repeatedly detected later on permanent sections. Negative margins on permanent section were finally reached after three resections and infraorbital soft tissue was plastically reconstructed with a buccal rotation flap. After surgery, chemotherapy followed with six cycles of alpha-interferon.Figure 3

Five months later a periorbital redness and swelling on both sides (Figure 4) required another incisional biopsy, which was confirmed as recurrent angiosarcoma on histopathological examination. Imaging staging procedures (MRI and CT head-neck, CT chest, CT abdomen, PET and bone scan) found bone invasion to the nasal root (Figure 5). Metastases to the neck lymph nodes as well as distant metastases were clinically and radiologically excluded.Figure 4

Neither radiochemotherapy with a cumulative radiation dose of 64.8 Gy and seven cycles Doxorubicin nor an additional antiangiogenetic therapy with Trofosfamide, Pioglitazone, Rofecoxibe and steroids could prevent the rapid tumour progression. The patient died 21 months after the first diagnosis.DiscussionThere are three main types of cutaneous angiosarcoma: Idiopathic angiosarcoma of the head and neck in elderly patients, lymphoedema-associated angiosarcoma (Stewart-Treves-Syndrome) and postirradiation angiosarcoma [2]. Besides an association with persistent chronic lymphoedema, previous irradiation and pre-existing vascular malformation, little is known regarding the causative factors of that disease [3]. With respect to pathogenesis, among others, upregulation of the glykopeptide VEGF-D, a vascular endothelial growth factor, seems to be responsible for the endothelial cell proliferation [4].Clinically the appearance of a cutaneous angiosarcoma of the skin and scalp can be variable. Early lesions most commonly present as single or multifocal ill-defined, bruise-like erythematous-purplish areas with indurated borders [5]. In the present case, akin to those previously described by others [6, 7], these haematoma-like lesions can be misinterpreted as benign inflammatory or allergic hyperemias. More advanced lesions can present as dark bluish, sometimes keratotic papules or nodules with ulceration and bleeding, mimicking other malignancies like squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, lymphoma as well as metastases [3, 5, 8].Microscopically a cutaneous angiosarcoma is typically characterized by numerous, irregular and anastomosing vascular channels. These are lined by pleomorphic, hyperchromatic endothelial cells with variable mitotic activity [9]. Immunhistochemical positivity for the endothelial markers CD 31 and factor VIII-related antigen as well as for the transcription factor Fli-1 may help to establish diagnosis [10, 11]. The differential diagnosis includes hemangioma, especially tufted, cavernous and epithelioid hemangioma on the one hand and acantholytic carcinoma on the other hand. Especially in immunocompromised patients Kaposi-sarcoma might be a further differential diagnosis. In the current case the presence of many lymphocytes might be a hint to regard the lesion as of lymphatic vessel origin, i.e. as a lymphangiosarcoma.Treatment of the cutaneous angiosarcoma is generally based on radical surgery and postoperative radiation therapy. Surgery is postulated to attain a wide excision of the tumour with histologically negative margins [1, 4]. Unfortunately achieving negative margins is difficult, as multifocal and extensive microscopic spread is common in this disease. Intraoperative frozen sections are often performed to assist in determining section margins. Pawlik et al. [5] demonstrated, however, an overall negative predictive value of only 33.3% for that procedure, which explains the repeating surgical resections in the case report. For this reason, temporary reconstruction with homografts or skin substitutes is recommended until the definite histological confirmation of margin status. Since up to 78% of the patients still have residual tumour after wide and multiple surgical resections [5, 12], this goal of achieving histologically negative section margins remains debatable. In many cases the resulting extensive resection defects require large secondary plastic reconstruction.More recently, chemotherapy and gene therapy are increasingly available. Doxorubicin is reported to be active in angiosarcoma [13], but did not show response in the present patient. Paclitaxel is another agent, that seems to have substantial effects, even in patients, who were treated previously with chemotherapy or radiation therapy [2, 14]. In more palliative situations, antiangiogentic therapy with pioglitazone, rofecoxib and metronomic trofosfamide has been recommended [15].ConclusionDespite multimodal therapy options, prognosis of the cutaneous angiosarcoma is still poor, with a 5-year-survival rate between 12% and 33%. About half of the patients are dying within 15 to 18 months of presentation [1, 5, 16]. The most important positive prognostic factors seem to be young age, small tumour size, negative resection margins and radiation therapy [3, 5, 8].In summary, the present case of a cutaneous angiosarcoma of the face elucidates the current diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma of this lesion. Diagnosis is often delayed, due to its putatively innocous clinical appearance. Negative microscopic section margins are hardly achieved during surgery, resulting in multiple operations with large postoperative defects. Despite multimodal therapy concepts, the prognosis remains poor.Consent sectionWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor-In-Chief of this journal.

Abstract

Sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is a neoplasm derived from the adnexal epithelium of the sebaceous glands, and most studies on this neoplasm have been conducted in Caucasians. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 29 patients with SC (16 extraocular and 13 ocular lesions) who were diagnosed from 2001 to 2014 to analyze the clinical and histopathological features of SC in the Korean population. Sixteen of the patients were women and 13 were men. There was an equal sex distribution for extraocular lesions, and a female predilection (M:F = 1:1.6) for ocular lesions. The mean ages at presentation of extraocular and ocular lesions were 69.19 ¬± 37.19 (range, 32‚Äì87) and 67.46 ¬± 24.46 (range, 43‚Äì85) years, respectively. Most lesions occurred in the eyelid (13/29, 44.83%), and most extraocular lesions occurred in the head and neck area (13/16, 81.25%). There was no recurrence or death during the follow-up period. Most lesions were poorly differentiated (extraocular, 43.75%; ocular, 38.46%), had a lobular infiltrative growth pattern (extraocular, 68.75%; ocular, 76.92%), and were basaloid (extraocular, 56.25%; ocular, 61.54%). Only 5 cases (2 extraocular and 3 ocular lesions) showed pagetoid spread. Extraocular lesions were marginally more common than the ocular form. There were higher incidences in elderly patients, who also had the highest incidence of eyelid lesions. The proportion of cells with sebaceous differentiation and prominent growth patterns were variable. Our results show that SC may not be very aggressive in Koreans.

INTRODUCTION

Sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is a rare malignant neoplasm that arises from the adnexal epithelium of sebaceous glands (1). Most SCs develop de novo and present as a highly aggressive form, although they may originate from benign sebaceous neoplasms. The most common clinical presentation is a painless, slowly enlarging subcutaneous nodule; however, SC may exhibit various colors and morphology depending on its site of origin. SCs have been traditionally classified into 2 groups: ocular type and extraocular type (2). SC can histologically be classified into well-, moderately, or poorly differentiated depending on the degree of differentiation and cellular atypia. The clinical presentation and histopathology of SC are so diverse that the diagnosis can often be missed.
In Koreans, limited data are available on the clinical and histopathological characteristics of patients with SCs, particularly the extraocular type. Herein, we analyzed 29 patients with histopathologically proven SC at Chonbuk National University Hospital. The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical and histopathological characteristics of both ocular and extraocular SC in Koreans.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Between January 2001 and October 2014, 29 patients were histologically diagnosed with SC at Chonbuk National University Hospital. Their medical records and pathologic slides were reviewed retrospectively.

Clinical features
The following clinical data were obtained: age, sex, location, duration, tumor size and color, lymph node (LN) and distant metastasis, treatment modalities, and recurrence. T staging for the primary tumor was evaluated based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging (3).


Histopathological features
Our histopathological review mainly focused on the degree of differentiation, overall growth patterns, cell types, and intraepithelial spread. The histological classification was based on Font's classification: well-differentiated, moderately differentiated, or poorly differentiated tumors (1). Prominent patterns of infiltrative growth were categorized into lobular, papillary, trabecular, and others. The existence of comedonecrosis showing total cellular dissolution in the centers of lobular lesions was also assessed. The infiltrative cell type was categorized into epidermoid, basaloid, basosquamous, and others. We also assessed whether there was pagetoid intraepithelial spread.


Ethics statement
The present study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chonbuk National University Hospital (IRB No. 2015-08-018-001). Informed consent was obtained from all participants before they were enrolled in the study.

RESULTS


Demographic data
Of the 29 patients who were diagnosed with SC, 16 were identified as having extraocular SC and 13 as having ocular SC (Table 1). The mean age at presentation was 69.19 ¬± 37.19 (range, 32‚Äì87) years for patients with extraocular SCs and 67.46 ¬± 24.46 (range, 43‚Äì85) years for patients with ocular SCs. Both extraocular and ocular SCs occurred most commonly in the 8th decade. The second most common age group was the 7th decade (Fig. 1). There was no sexual difference in the frequency of extraocular SC occurrence; however, ocular SC had a female preponderance (8/13, 61.54%). The eyelid (13/29, 44.83%) was the most common site of SC. The most common site of extraocular SC was the scalp (5/16, 31.25%), followed by the cheek (3/16, 18.75%) and temple (2/16, 12.50%). The other locations were the forehead, nose, neck, axilla, forearm, and scrotum. The most common site of ocular SC was the upper eyelid (7/13, 53.84%), followed by the lower eyelid (4/13, 30.77%).

Clinical findings
The clinical data are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Differently colored tumors were observed. Of the 16 extraocular SCs, 7 were pink (43.75%), 3 were flesh colored (18.75%), 2 were red (12.50%), 2 were brown (12.50%), and 2 were yellow (12.50%) (Fig. 2). Yellow tumors were the most common in ocular SCs (7/13, 53.85%), followed by flesh colored (3/13, 23.08%) and pink (1/13, 7.69%). Off-white colored tumors were only found in ocular SCs (2/13, 15.38%) (Fig. 3). Four extraocular SCs were associated with bleeding.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; 6/16, 37.50%) was the most common clinical diagnosis for extraocular SCs, and chalazion (7/13, 53.85%) was the most common diagnosis for ocular SCs. Distant metastasis was not observed in any patient, and only one patient with extraocular SC showed metastasis to a cervical LN. Most of the patients with extraocular SCs had tumors in stage T1 (13/16, 81.25%) and the rest had tumors in stage T2 (3/16, 18.75%); however, patients with ocular SCs had tumors in various T stages (T1: 1/13, 7.69%; T2a: 8/13, 61.54%; T2b: 3/13, 23.08%; and T3a: 1/13, 7.69%).
The extraocular SCs were resected via Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) with a 2-mm margin (first MMS, 9/16, 56.25%) and wide local excision (WLE) with a 5‚Äì6-mm margin (WLE, 7/16, 43.75%). Most of the ocular SCs were removed by WLE with a 5‚Äì6-mm margin (12/13, 92.31%). The patients were followed-up for an average of 32.06 months (range, 2‚Äì60 months) for extraocular SC and 30.46 months (range, 4‚Äì60 months) for ocular SC after surgery. During the follow-up period, there was no recurrence or death reported.


Histopathological findings
Details of the main histological features are shown in Table 4. The poorly differentiated tumor type was most commonly observed in both extraocular (7/16, 43.75%) and ocular (5/13, 38.46%) SCs. In extraocular SC, moderately differentiated and well-differentiated types were found in 6 (37.50%) and 3 patients (18.75%), respectively. In ocular SC, moderately differentiated and well-differentiated types were evenly distributed (n = 3, 23.08% for each) (Fig. 4A-C).

The majority of prominent patterns of infiltrative growth were lobular (Fig. 4D) in both extraocular (11/16, 68.75%) and ocular (10/13, 76.92%) SCs. A trabecular pattern (Fig. 4E) was observed in 3 extraocular and 1 ocular SCs, and a papillary pattern (Fig. 4F) was observed in only 2 extraocular SCs. Comedonecrosis was found in 6 extraocular (37.50%) and 3 ocular (23.08%) SCs. Basaloid cells (Fig. 4G) were the most common infiltrative cell type in both extraocular (9/16, 56.25%) and ocular (8/13, 61.54%) SCs. Epidermoid or squamous cell types (Fig. 4H) were found in 5 extraocular (31.25%) and 3 ocular (23.08%) SCs. A basosquamous cell type (Fig. 4I) was found in only 2 extraocular SCs (12.50%) and pagetoid intraepithelial spread (Fig. 4J) was found in 2 extraocular (12.50%) and 3 ocular (23.08%) SCs.

DISCUSSION

SC is very rarely diagnosed in clinical settings because its presentation is similar to that of other benign and malignant lesions, and making a histological diagnosis is not easy because of its rarity and the difficulty in determining the sebaceous differentiation of tumor cells (4). In the literature, it has been called a sebaceous gland carcinoma, a sebaceous cell carcinoma, and a Meibomian gland carcinoma; however, recently, SC has been accepted as the commonly used term (2). The literature regarding SC is insufficient, although there have been many published studies, including a recent retrospective review of 1,349 SC cases from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of the National Cancer Institute in the US (5). Very limited data in Korea are available for patients with SC and for the extraocular type in particular, and the data available consists primarily of single case reports (6-18). We analyzed 29 cases of SC, which is the largest number of Korean SC cases reported in a study to date.
Our data are consistent with previous studies reporting that SCs primarily occur in the skin of the eyelid or in the extraocular skin of the head and neck region, where sebaceous glands are more concentrated (5, 19, 20). The predilection for the upper eyelid is believed to be related to the relatively greater number of modified sebaceous (Meibomian) glands that are present in the upper eyelids (21). Although it has been reported that ocular SC occurs equally between the sexes and extraocular SC is more common in men (22), our study showed a female predominance in ocular SC, an equal sex distribution in extraocular SC, and a slight female predominance in the entire cohort. SC associated with Muir-Torre syndrome has been rarely reported, and no such patient was included in our study (23, 24).
Since the known risk factors for SC include Asian ethnicity, SC has been thought to have a higher incidence in Asian countries (3). However, a recent review of the SEER data demonstrated that there was no Asian predominance in the overall incidence of SC (5). This may be attributed to the relatively small number of other skin malignancies in Asians, such that SC seems to have a higher incidence. There are currently no data available on the incidence of SC in Korea. To determine the exact incidence of SC in Korea, multi-institutional data collection involving large referral centers is required.
The clinical presentation of SC is varied depending on the location of the lesion. Extraocular SC usually appears as a painless pink or yellow nodule; however, it can also present as flesh-colored to red papules, plaques, or nodules (3). Bleeding associated with SC was reported in approximately one-third of the cases in previous studies (1, 25); however, in our study only 25% (4/16) of patients with extraocular SC showed bleeding from the tumor. Only 15.4% (2/13) of patients with stage T1 disease and 66.7% (2/3) with T2 disease presented with bleeding. Three had a moderately differentiated type (3/6, 50%), and 1 case was a poorly differentiated type (1/7, 14.3%) (Table 5). Intraepithelial spread was not observed in all 4 cases. However, we were not able to identify a significant relationship between bleeding and aggressive behavior because there were too few patients in this study.

The clinical differential diagnosis of extraocular SC includes various neoplastic conditions such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), SCC, amelanotic melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and cutaneous lymphoma, or non-neoplastic benign sebaceous conditions such as nevus sebaceus, xanthoma, and sarcoidosis (3). Ocular SC, usually appearing as a yellow or pink painless nodule, is easily mistaken for a chalazion, which is a benign mass, and this can cause delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Other conditions to be considered while establishing a diagnosis include blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis, BCC, SCC, and other benign sebaceous neoplasms (26). A skin biopsy should be performed in every case that is suspected to be SC, in particular when recurrent chalazion, eyelid thickening, lash loss, lid eversion, or ulceration of the eyelid are present (27). In our study, the most frequent clinical diagnoses of extraocular SC and ocular SC were SCC and chalazion, respectively.
SC has been reported to be an aggressive tumor, and metastasis and mortality rates have been reported to be as high as 29% in some series (25, 28, 29, 30, 31). However, a recent study of the 2009 SEER database (5) has reported a rate of regional LN involvement of 1.3%, and an involvement of distant or unspecified LNs in only 0.4% of cases. Among our 29 patients, only 1 patient with extraocular SC showed regional LN involvement (3.4%), and no distant metastasis or death during the follow-up period was observed. This suggests that, contrary to widely held assumptions, SC might not be aggressive in most cases. Our case with cervical LN metastasis showed moderately differentiated, lobular and basaloid SC, and a lack of intraepithelial spread. The size of the lesion was 1.2 cm (T1), and it was associated with bleeding. However, these features cannot be considered significant, because there was only one case.
The staging of SC is different according to its location based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM classification guidelines for non-melanoma skin cancers (32). The role of TNM staging for extraocular SC for predicting prognosis and management has not been studied; however, the relationship between TNM staging and disease progression has recently been validated by a retrospective cohort study of ocular SC. Stage T2b disease or higher T category in ocular SC can be predictive of nodal metastasis, and T3a disease or higher T category can be predictive of cancer specific mortality (33). Four of our patients with ocular SCs had tumors at stage T2b or higher; however, there was no nodal metastasis. Extraocular SC has been thought to be less aggressive than ocular SC, consistent with the findings of our study that indicate that ocular SC has a higher average T stage than extraocular SC.
Based on the degree of differentiation, SC can be classified into 3 categories: well-, moderately, or poorly differentiated (34). Previous studies have shown variable results with regard to these categories (1, 35), and in our study, approximately 40% of tumors were classified as poorly differentiated. Commonly recognized histological patterns of infiltrative growth include lobular, papillary, and trabecular. The most common pattern in our study was the lobular pattern; this result is consistent with those of previous studies. The lobules may vary in size within the same tumor, and some lobulated tumors can display central necrosis (comedonecrosis). This specific finding is described as foci of exaggerated holocrine secretion rather than true necrosis.
The main cell types encountered in SC are basaloid, basosquamous, and epidermoid (36). Although mixtures of various types may be observed in the same specimen, only the dominant cell type was recorded in our study, and we found the most common infiltrative cell type was basaloid in both ocular and extraocular SCs. The basaloid type corresponds to the outer germinal cells of the secretory alveoli with scant cytoplasm, and it shows a strong hematoxylinophilia and a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. In the epidermoid cell type, more visible eosinophilic cytoplasm may be observed, and it may display scattered dyskeratotic cells or nonkeratinizing cellular whorls (1). The basosquamous cell type displays intermediate cytoplasmic features of the basaloid and epidermoid types and more copious cytoplasm than basaloid cell type (36). Ocular lesions often show a pagetoid pattern in the overlying conjunctiva or epidermis of the eyelid (25, 37). This feature was observed in one-third of all cases in one series (38). Such changes are very rarely seen in extraocular SC; however, these changes were observed in the ocular SCs (3 cases) as well as extraocular SCs (2 cases) in our study.
Immunostaining, including BerEP4, ADP, EMA, p53, Ki-67, and adipophilin staining for cytoplasmic lipids, is useful in diagnosing SC and differentiating it from SCC and BCC. Recently, staining for the androgen receptor was reported to be useful in diagnosing SC (39). Further studies using immunohistochemistry are warranted in Korea.
Surgical resection with WLE is the standard therapy for SC; however, MMS may have lower recurrence rates and maximal tissue conservation. A surgical margin of 5‚Äì6-mm in WLE is commonly recommended for SCs, and a 2-mm margin in MMS has been reported to be effective (40). Although more studies comparing the long-term outcomes of MMS vs. WLE are necessary, MMS is recognized as the best initial treatment modality for SC (39). Both WLE and initial MMS in our study showed excellent results.
SC often masquerades as an inflammatory disease or other tumors in both clinical and histological findings, leading to misdiagnosis and delays in proper management. A comprehensive clinicopathologic analysis of both ocular and extraocular SC has not yet been performed in Korea. Although this retrospective study has a small sample size and is limited to a single center, we expect this study to make a significant contribution to the diagnosis and management of SC in Korea.

        Abstract



Sebaceous gland carcinoma, commonly arises in the periocular area, is an uncommon condition. It represents 1‚Äì5.5% of eyelid malignancies and is considered to be the third most common eyelid malignancy after basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, although few reports placed this tumor as second most common after basal cell carcinoma. It usually affects elderly women and characterized by high rate of local recurrence, regional, and distant metastases. A delay in diagnosis, which can be attributed primarily to ability of this tumor to masquerade as more benign conditions, often leads to inappropriate management with increased morbidity and mortality rates. In this study, the authors discuss key elements of the primary disease and therapeutic options available to treat such devastating problem.


Introduction
Sebaceous gland tumor of the eyelids may arise from the meibomian glands, glands of Zeis or glands associated with the caruncle.[1] They are included in the list of tumors of the epidermal appendages, so-called adnexal skin structures. Sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC) might be the second most common lid malignancy after basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Its multifocal origin and pagetoid spread give it an unique place among eyelid malignancies.
Sebaceous glands are located in the periocular skin, caruncle, and eyebrow skin follicles. The tumor is a very rare, slow growing, and commonly found in elderly population with female predisposition. Mean age at diagnosis is mid-sixties; however, the tumor has been reported in children as young as 3.5 years old.[2] It is rare in Caucasians and common in oriental Asiatics. The reported incidence of SGC varies from 0.5 to 5% of all lid carcinomas in USA and 28% in China.[34] SGC most commonly arises from the meibomian glands anterior to the gray line, occasionally from the glands of Zeis or Moll, and from sebaceous glands in caruncle; however, the cell of origin may not be certain in 50‚Äì60% of cases.[5] In contrast to basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), SGC is two to three times more common in upper eyelid due to more number of meibomian glands there.[36] Five percent cases may have simultaneous involvement of both eyelids due to intraepithelial spread and/or spontaneous development of multiple primaries.
On one hand it can mimic as benign lesion as blepharoconjunctivitis, whereas on the other extreme it can have widespread local and fatal distant metastases. Immunohistochemistry, molecular biology, and electron microscopy have greatly improved the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of SGCs overall. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy all contribute to the treatment of SGC.
The literature was reviewed using online searches of PubMed (1985‚Äì2010), OVID, and Google Scholar. The search strategy included MeSH and natural language terms using the keywords mentioned. Reference lists in retrieved articles, and textbooks, were also searched for relevant references.
Relevant Anatomy
With its two parts; the epithelial or epidermis and the cutaneous or dermis, the skin of the eyelid is the thinnest in the body. Anatomically, the eyelid can be divided into two lamellae. The anterior lamella contains skin, orbicularis muscle, eyelashes, and their follicles whereas the posterior lamella has mucocutaneous junction, meibomian gland orifices, and tarsal plate.
The dermis contains sebaceous glands which are found in the tarsal plate, caruncle, and eye brow. There are approximately 25 such oil producing sebaceous glands in the upper tarsal plate and 20 in the lower. Glands of Zeis are small, modified, sebaceous secreting glands that open into the hair follicles at the base of the eyelashes.
Pathophysiology
Two important features differentiate sebaceous carcinoma from other periocular malignancies. First, unlike single origin of other tumors, sebaceous carcinoma appears to arise from multifocal origins. Second, unlike radial spread of basal cell and SCCs, SGC tends to spread superficially in a pattern known as pagetoid spread.[78] This spread may lead to the erroneous histologic diagnosis of epithelial dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.
Immunohistopathology shows that the cells occur in irregular lobular masses with distinctive invasiveness. The cytoplasm is pale, foamy, and vacuolated [Figure 1]. This feature of foamy cytoplasm is seen only in sebaceous carcinoma. The nuclei are hyperchromatic, and the cells stain positive for lipid such as oil red O stain. The ultrastructural features of SGC include desmosoes, tonofilaments, and intracytoplasmic nonmembrane bound lipid. Occasionally bizarre and atypical tripolar mitotic cells may be seen. Immunohistochemical reaction aids in the diagnosis of SGC. Molecular biology of SGC suggests dysplasia if there is no expression of p53 or invasiveness, if there is hyperexpression of p53.Figure 1: Malignant cells with vaculated cytoplasm (V), mitotic figures (M), and areas of necrosis (N) (H & E, √ó60)Clinical Features
SGC has a tendency to invade the periocular region. Upper eyelid is most commonly involved followed by the lower eyelid and the caruncle.[9]
It bears no characteristic clinical appearance, but pagetoid infiltration of conjunctival epithelium or skin epidermis is a hallmark of this tumor. It is one of the most dangerous eyelid tumors due to; a) the tumor masquerading as inflammatory conditions such as blepharo-conjunctivitis, chalazion or superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis,[10‚Äì12] or as other ocular tumors like BCC or SCC, with a result that the correct diagnosis is often delayed until metastasis has occurred, b) the incidence of metastasis is high (41%),[357] c) delineation of tumor margins, even with excellent paraffin-embedded sections is difficult due to either intraepithelial pagetoid spread and/or multicentric pattern,[56813‚Äì15] and d) the histological diagnosis may be incorrect if lipid stains (oil-red-O) are not used on properly prepared tissues.
In general, there are two main pathological presentations of the SGC - nodular and spreading.
The Nodular Form
In over 50% cases, SGC may present as a pseudochalazion or a chronic blepharoconjunctivitis.[10‚Äì121617] The nodular form is a discrete, hard, immobile nodule commonly located in upper tarsal plate [Figure 2]. It is yellowish due to lipid. Any chalazion of unusual consistency or its recurrence after incision and curettage more than three times should undergo full thickness resection and histological examination. Occasionally, it may have a multicentric origin.Figure 2: Clinical presentation showing large mass of the right upper eyelidThe spreading variety of SGC occurs in pagetoid form with diffuse intraepithelial infiltration of the lid skin.[81113] This causes diffuse thickening of lid margin, loss of eyelashes, and resembles chronic blepharoconjunctivitis. The pagetoid spread may involve both eyelids and conjunctival epithelium.[13]
An unusual variant of SGC may present as Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome which is characterized by squamous differentiation of the tumor, multiple sebaceous adenomas or carcinomas in the skin, and visceral malignancies.
SGC is important to know because it is a notorious diagnostic pitfall for the clinician as well as the pathologist. It is the pagetoid spread or the dermal infiltration of the tumor that may confuse both the clinician and the pathologist. The clinician may misdiagnose SGC as blepharoconjunctivitis, and the pathologist as dysplasia. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of SGC are important because this tumor is the most aggressive of the epithelial tumors of the eyelid. Any unilateral blepharoconjunctivitis with loss of eyelashes, thickening of the lid margin and that fails to respond to the treatment should be biopsied, so should be any suspicious area of conjunctiva or the limbus.
Sebaceous gland hyperplasia constitutes 8% of caruncular growths. SGC of caruncle may involve mucous membrane graft of the defect after excision of the tumor.
The systemic extension of the tumor can occur by continuous growth, lymphatic spread, or hematogenous spread. The most common sites of spread are orbit, preauricular and/or submandibulr nodes, and parotid gland. The less common sites of extension include cervical nodes, lung, pleura, liver, brain, pericardium, lips, ethmoid sinus, or skull.[3561819]
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is frequently difficult due to two main reasons; (1) in early stages the external signs are quite subtle, resembling a benign lesion such as a chalazion or chronic blepharoconjunctivitis and (2) the presence of yellowish material within the tumor gives it resemblance to SCC.
Thus, due to high index of suspicion, it becomes mandatory to include SGC in the differential diagnosis of most eyelid masses and recurrent, nonresponding eyelid inflammatory conditions.
A delay in clinical diagnosis of SGC can be attributed primarily to its ability to masquerade as more common benign eyelid conditions. This often leads to delayed management with increased morbidity and mortality rates.[20] The actual reported sebaceous carcinoma-related mortality is about 6%.[7]
Differential Diagnosis
The list for SGC includes; congenital sebaceous gland hyperplasia which is common on face or scalp or acquired sebaceous gland hyperplasia which is common on face or forehead. Adenoma sebaceum of Pringle is another diagnosis to consider. It is found in tuberous sclerosis and commonly located in the nasolabial fold and cheek areas. Sebaceous adenoma is common on the eyebrows and eyelids.
SGC is included in the group of simulating lid lesions (inclusion cyst, papilloma, senile keratosis, keratoacanthoma, benign keratosis, dermoid cyst, and amyloidosis).
Occasionally, SGC may diffusely infiltrate conjunctival epithelium. This may resemble lesions such as chronic blepharoconjunctivitis, superior limbal keratoconjunctivitis or cicatricial pemphigoid, and BCC. The tumor may mimick chronic inflammation and even grow bacteria on repeated cultures but does not improve with antibiotics. Conjunctival scrapping may reveal the underlying SGC pathology. Due to such mimicking, SGC is one of the forms of masquerade syndromes. Diffuse intraepithelial sebaceous carcinoma closely resembles SGC in its rarity and indolent course; however, the former is not an obvious primary tumor of the eyelid and may not require exenteration. Papilloma simulates SGC and sometimes may be differentiated only by histology.
Treatment
SGCs are often inadequately treated at first intervention. Different treatment modalities include local excision, orbital exenteration, radical neck dissection, radiation, or chemotherapy depending on the stage of the tumor at the time of presentation. Wide excision at an early stage is important. Prior to surgical excision, it is important to examine the patient carefully for evidence of pagetoid spread or multicentric origin by double eversion of the eyelids, and any conjunctival alteration such as telangiectasia, papillary change, or a mass. In such an instance, conjunctival punch biopsies should be taken in addition to surgical resection of the lid lesion.[21]
Surgical treatment may range from a local excision to orbital exenteration [Figure 3]. Radical surgical excision with frozen section control by either a standard method or Moh‚Äôs micrographic surgery is the most common and effective method of treatment. The wound edges should be approximated as far as possible. Approximately, 30% of SGCs recur after resection.[1822]Figure 3: Two weeks after surgical resection of the tumor and reconstruction of the eyelidThe advantages of Moh‚Äôs micrographic surgery, in comparison to a conventional excision of nonmelanotic skin cancer are; (1) definitive margin excision and (2) minimal loss of surrounding normal tissue.[23]
Few patients with regional nodal metastasis remain alive for long time, and radical neck dissection for isolated cervical node disease is often indicated.[6] Local nodal disease without distant metastasis is treated by radical neck dissection.[71819]
Topical mitomycin C has been tried for pagetoid invasion of the conjunctiva by eyelid SGC.[24] Cryotherapy is a useful adjunct to surgery in epibulbar and pagetoid extension of SGC, sparing exenteration.
Radiotherapy is usually avoided or may even be contraindicated because of its adverse side effects such as subsequent conjunctival keratinization leading to dry eye, lid atrophy, skin necrosis, lash loss, lid telangiectasia, ectropion, epiphora, keratopathy, cataract,[25] higher recurrence rate compared to surgery, does not allow histological confirmation of tumor classification and eradication and finally recurrences following radiotherapy are difficult to treat surgically because of poor healing of irradiated tissues. Most serious radiation-related complications occur in large tumors of the upper lid.
The reported results of proton electron irradiation in SGC are not excellent.[2226] Radiotherapy as a primary form of therapy in SGC of the eyelid has variable results.[72627] Radiation is mainly reserved for patients who are not candidates for surgical procedures due to advanced age or disease, for palliation in widespread disease, and for patients who refuse exenteration for advanced local disease. In some cases, wide-field irradiation has either cured the tumor or produced sufficient shrinkage to allow surgical removal of the residual mass. As a bias, surgery has been recommended for SGC confined to the lid, and to limit the use of radiation to diffuse tumors with orbital or bone involvement. In advanced poorly differentiated tumors, cure is not affected by either radiotherapy or orbital exenteration.
Prognosis [Table 1]
The overall mortality rate is 5‚Äì10% because of frequent difficulties, mistakes in diagnosis, and delay in the treatment. The mortality from metastasis may go up to 25%. The adverse prognostic features include involvement of upper or both eyelid and tumor size of 10 mm or more. Others include duration of symptoms more than 6 months (mortality 38%), poorly differentiated tumors, infiltration into blood vessels and/or lymphatics, orbital extension, multicentric origin, and finally pagetoid spread. Tumors less than 6 mm have excellent prognosis. Prognosis of SGC arising from glands of Zeis is more favorable.Table 1: Prognosis of sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC) based on clinicopathological tumor morphology[28]It goes beyond doubt that SGC is a great mimicker. On one hand, it mimics as simple a clinical condition as blepharitis, on the other hand it may turn out to be a fatal metastatic tumor.REFERENCES

AbstractMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy of the skin. The cell of origin of MCC is thus far unknown and proposed cells of origin include Merkel cells, pro-/pre- or pre-B cells, epithelial stem cells, and dermal stem cells. In this study, we aimed to shed further light on the possibility that a subset of MCC tumors arise from epithelial stem cells of the skin by examining the expression of hair follicle and epidermal stem cell markers in MCC and normal human skin. We also aimed to elucidate any correlation between the expression of these markers and tumor Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) status or other clinicopathological characteristics or patient survival. Expression of CK19, SOX9, LGR5, and LRIG1 in MCC and normal human skin was studied by immunohistochemistry, and the staining patterns or intensities were statistically correlated with patient, tumor, MCPyV, and survival parameters. In a cohort of 137 cases of MCC, we observed dot-like immunoexpression of CK19 in 30 cases (22.1%) and homogeneous expression in 103 cases (75.7%). We also observed positive immunoexpression of SOX9 in 21 cases (15.3%), LGR5 in 118 cases (86.1%), and LRIG1 in 117 cases (86.0%). Immunoexpression of LRIG1 was found to correlate with better overall and MCC-specific survival. We observed frequent immunoexpression of several hair follicle and epidermal stem cell markers in MCC and found LRIG1 to be a positive prognostic marker in MCC.

IntroductionMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. The cellular origins of this rare and highly aggressive skin cancer subtype are thus far unknown. Based on protein expression patterns and ultrastructural findings, MCC tumor cells share many similarities with Merkel cells, mechanoreceptive cells located in the basal layer of the epidermis. In the majority of MCCs‚Äîapproximately 80% of MCC tumors in the northern hemisphere‚Äîthe DNA genome of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is integrated in the tumor cell genome, and this is considered the causative agent for tumorigenesis in MCPyV infection [1, 2]. We and others have previously shown significant morphologic and clinicopathological differences between MCPyV-positive and MCPyV-negative MCCs [2,3,4,5,6].Because of their phenotypic similarities, MCC was initially believed to arise from Merkel cells that had undergone malignant transformation. Several arguments against this theory have since been presented, notably that Merkel cells are post-mitotic and that neuroendocrine carcinomas in other organs tend to arise from epithelial progenitors rather than from the neuroendocrine cells themselves [7,8,9]. Furthermore, neuroendocrine differentiation in Merkel cell progenitors is triggered by ATOH1 expression [9]. ATOH1 has also been found to be expressed in MCC, and, as such, the acquisition of a Merkel cell-like phenotype in MCC could occur during the oncogenic process [10]. Based on the expression of several B-lymphoid lineage markers in MCC, it has been suggested that the cell of origin for MCC could be a pro-/pre- or pre-B cell [11].Other cells that have been suggested as the cell of origin for MCC are fibroblasts, dermal stem cells, and epithelial stem cells of the skin, notably the stem cells of the hair follicles [12,13,14,15]. Arguments have also been tendered for MCC having more than one cell of origin, for example, MCPyV-positive MCC arising from a dermal progenitor and MCPyV-negative MCC arising from an epithelial stem cell of the skin, which would be consistent with MCPyV-negative MCC harboring a high mutational burden and a UV signature that is lacking in MCPyV-positive MCC [16,17,18]. Another finding alluding to some cases of MCC arising from epithelial stem cells is the presence of so-called combined MCC, in which MCPyV-negative MCC is found in conjunction with another carcinoma component, most commonly eccrine or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) [19]. In some cases, these represent collision tumors, but in others, there is evidence of clonality between the MCC and SCC components, hinting at an ancestral cell with differentiation potential into both types of cells [20].In this study, we aimed to shed further light on the possibility that a subset of MCC tumors arise from epithelial stem cells of the skin by examining the expression of cytokeratin-19 (CK19), leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), and SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9), markers of hair follicle stem cells [21,22,23], as well as leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains protein 1 (LRIG1), a marker of both hair follicle stem cells and stem cells of the interfollicular epidermis [24, 25], in MCC and normal human skin. We also aimed to elucidate whether there is a correlation between the expression of these markers and tumor MCPyV status or other clinicopathological characteristics or patient survival.Patients and methodsThe study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Helsinki University Central Hospital. The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs granted permission to collect patient data and the National Authority for Medicolegal Affairs to collect tissue samples.Patients, clinical data, and tissue samplesData on patients diagnosed with MCC in Finland from 1979 to 2018 were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry and Helsinki University Hospital files. Clinical details were extracted from hospital records. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were retrieved from the pathology archives. MCC diagnoses were confirmed in a blinded fashion from our earlier studies according to well-established criteria by two researchers with special expertise in MCC pathology [26].MCPyV detection from paraffinized tumor blocks was performed in our previous study and is described in detail elsewhere [2]. Briefly, the presence of MCPyV DNA was analyzed from DNA extracted from representative deparaffinized tumor sections. Quantitation of MCPyV DNA was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The relative DNA sequence copy number for each tissue sample was expressed as a ratio of MCPyV DNA to protein tyrosine phosphatase gamma receptor gene DNA. The sample was considered positive when MCPyV DNA copy number per reference gene was greater than 0.1. MCPyV large T (LT) antigen expression was evaluated as described earlier [27]. Tissue microarray (TMA) blocks with 374 MCC tissue cores corresponding to 168 patients as well as five formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks containing normal human skin were used for immunohistochemistry.ImmunohistochemistryFour-micrometer sections were cut from the TMA blocks to create four slides from each TMA block to be used for immunohistochemical staining of CK19, LGR5, LRIG1, and SOX9. The same was done for the blocks containing normal human skin.The primary antibodies used were recombinant anti-cytokeratin 19 antibody (clone EP1580Y) (cat# ab52625 Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 1:1000 dilution, recombinant anti-LGR5 antibody (clone EPR3065Y) (cat# ab75850 Abcam) at 1:150 dilution, anti-LRIG1 antibody (polyclonal) (cat# ab197985 Abcam) at 1:200 dilution, and recombinant anti-SOX9 antibody (clone EPR14335-78) (cat# ab185966 Abcam) at 1:1000 dilution. For all primary antibodies, overnight incubation at a temperature of 4¬†¬∞C was performed. Primary antibodies were detected by using an Orion detection system rabbit HRP (ready-to-use) kit (WellMed, Duiven, the Netherlands) and an ImmPACT DAB Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Counterstaining was performed with Mayer's hematoxylin (Lillie's modification) (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA), and the slides were cover-slipped with Menzel‚Ñ¢ Microscope Coverslips.Immunostaining evaluationThe TMA slides were digitally scanned using a 3DHISTECH Pannoramic 250 slide scanner, and the TMA spots were examined and evaluated for expression of CK19, LGR5, LRIG1, and SOX9 in their digital form. For the expression of LGR5 and LRIG1, a grading system was used in which the spots were classified as showing no expression, weak positive expression, or intermediate/strong positive expression. For SOX9, the spots were considered to show positive expression if at least 20% of the tumor cells in the spot stained positively for SOX9. For CK19, the spots were classified as showing either dot-like expression or homogeneous expression depending on which expression pattern was present in over 50% of the tumor cells; if no expression was observed, the spot was naturally classified as showing no expression. The degree of immunohistochemical expression for each patient case was determined by the highest degree of expression observed in a TMA spot corresponding to that patient, with homogeneous CK19 expression being considered a higher degree of expression than dot-like expression.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed with SPSS statistics 26.0 software (IBM Corporation, New York, NY, USA). P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. Immunoexpression of CK19, LGR5, LRIG1, and SOX9 was compared with gender, tumor location, sun-exposure pattern, presence of metastasis at diagnosis, MCPyV status, MCPyV LT expression, and immunoexpression of the three other studied markers by œá2 test or Fisher‚Äôs exact test. In terms of sun-exposure pattern, the head and neck and limb regions were considered sun-exposed, whereas the trunk was considered sun-protected. MCPyV status was defined as the presence or absence of MCPyV DNA. The statistical associations between the immunoexpression of CK19, LGR5, LRIG1, and SOX9 and the age at time of diagnosis as well as the size of the primary tumor were evaluated by Mann‚ÄìWhitney analysis or Kruskal‚ÄìWallis analysis. Cumulative survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meyer method, and survival between groups was compared by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Overall survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to death, censoring subjects alive on their last follow-up date. MCC-specific survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to death considered to be due to MCC. LRIG1 expression, age, stage at diagnosis, and MCPyV LT expression were considered in a Cox regression multivariate analysis of overall and MCC-specific survival using a subcohort of 90 patients that excluded patients for whom stage at diagnosis was not known, following an exclusion of the two patients known to have stage IV MCC at diagnosis. The staging system employed was the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification for Merkel cell carcinoma, eighth edition.ResultsOverview of patients¬† Detailed patient clinical data are shown in Table 1. After application of the exclusion criteria (expression data for at least three of the four studied markers and survival data available), our cohort included 137 MCC patients with a mean age at the time of MCC diagnosis of 77¬†years. Ninety-five (69%) of the patients were female. Two patients (1.5%) were kidney transplant recipients. The most common location for the primary tumors was the head and neck region, affecting 69 cases (55%). In four cases (2.9%), there was no known primary tumor. Tumor MCPyV status was available for 107 patients, with 68% of them being MCPyV-positive. The original cohort size was 168 patients; 27 patients were excluded because they lacked expression data for more than one of the studied markers since some of the TMA spots were missing or unrepresentative and 4 patients were excluded because survival data were missing due to the diagnosis date being unknown.Table 1 Clinicopathological features of patientsFull size tableCK19, LGR5, LRIG1, and SOX9 expression in normal human skinDemonstrations of staining patterns in normal human skin are shown in Fig.¬†1. For SOX9, expression in the interfollicular epidermis was generally restricted to individual cells in the basal layer. Expression was also observed in hair follicles as well as sweat- and sebaceous glands. For CK19, expression in the interfollicular epidermis was also generally restricted to individual cells in the basal layer. Expression was also observed in the outer root sheet of hair follicles as well as sweat, but not sebaceous glands. For LRIG1, there was intermediate expression in the hair follicles and interfollicular epidermis, weak expression in sebaceous glands, and strong expression in sweat glands and deeper regions of the hair follicles. For LGR5, expression was quite uniform throughout the interfollicular epidermis and hair follicles as well as sweat and sebaceous glands.Fig. 1Examples of staining patterns in a hair follicle of normal human skin stained for SOX9 (a), CK19 (b), LRIG1 (c), and LGR5 (d)Full size imageCK19, LGR5, LRIG1, and SOX9 expression in MCCDemonstrations of the different expression patterns and intensities are shown in Fig.¬†2, and a summary of the expression rates of the studied markers is provided in Table 2. Detailed data on the correlations between the expression of the studied markers and patient clinicopathological features can be found in Table 3 and Online Resources 1, 2, and 3. For SOX9, we recorded positive immunostaining in 21 samples (15.3%). We observed a significant association between SOX9 expression and MCPyV-negativity (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) and also between SOX9 expression and head and neck localization of the primary tumor (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.039). Furthermore, we noted a significant association between SOX9 expression and homogeneous CK19 expression (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.044).Fig. 2Examples of immunohistochemical staining results depicting dot-like and homogeneously positive CK19 expression (a and b), intermediate LGR5 expression (c), and strong LRIG1 expression (d), as well as heterogeneous and more homogeneous SOX9 expression (e and f)Full size imageTable 2 Summary of epidermal stem cell marker expression ratesFull size tableTable 3 Patient and tumor characteristics according to LRIG1 expressionFull size tableWe observed expression of CK19 in 133 samples (97.8%). Homogeneous expression was seen in 103 (75.7%) and dot-like expression in 30 (22.1%) of the samples. Dot-like expression of CK19 was significantly associated with MCPyV-positivity (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.034).For LGR5, we observed positive immunohistochemical staining in 118 samples (86.1%). Intermediate or strong expression was detected in 76 (55.5%) and weak expression in 42 samples (30.7%). There was a significant association between the degree of LGR5 expression and sun-exposed localization of the primary tumor that was specifically caused by preferential sun-exposed localization of cases exhibiting intermediate or strong LGR5 expression (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.024).Positive staining for LRIG1 was observed in 117 samples (86.0%; Table 3). Intermediate or strong expression was observed in 55 (40.4%) and weak expression in 42 samples (45.6%). We found a significant association between a higher degree of LRIG1 expression and better overall survival (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.037; Fig.¬†3). The 5-year overall survival rate was 15.8% for LRIG1-negative cases, 39.1% for cases showing weak LRIG1 expression, and 42.2% for cases showing intermediate or strong LRIG1 expression. A significant association also emerged between any degree of positive LRIG1 expression and better MCC-specific survival (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.021). The 5-year MCC-specific survival rate was 39.3% for LRIG1-negative cases and 69.5% for cases exhibiting any degree of positive LRIG1 expression. We also noted a significant association between a higher degree of LRIG1 expression and younger age at time of diagnosis (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003) and MCPyV LT expression (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.020). For LRIG1-negative cases, the median age at diagnosis and the expression rate of MCPyV LT were 85¬†years and 68.8%, respectively. For cases with weak LRIG1 expression, the corresponding numbers were 80.5¬†years and 32.1%, and for cases with intermediate or strong LRIG1 expression 76¬†years and 32.6%.Fig. 3Kaplan‚ÄìMeier analysis of survival among patients whose tumors exhibited intermediate or strong (+‚Äâ+), weak (‚Äâ+), or negative (-) LRIG1 expression. a Overall survival. b Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)-specific survival. Subject whose tumor exhibited LRIG1 expression had better overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] of death for weak expression‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI]‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.42 to 1.24, and HR of death for intermediate or strong expression‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.49, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.28 to 0.88, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.037) and MCC-specific survival (HR of death for weak expression‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.43, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.19 to 0.98, and HR of death for intermediate or strong expression‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.42, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.18 to 0.97, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.021*) than those whose tumor lacked LRIG1 expression. Five- and 10-year survival data are shown. *Obtained by comparing cases exhibiting no LRIG1 expression to cases exhibiting any degree of positive LRIG1 expressionFull size imageTo examine whether LRIG1 was an independent prognostic factor, univariate analyses of overall survival were carried out for age, gender, stage at diagnosis, MCPyV LT expression, and MCPyV DNA status to identify prognostic factors to include in a multivariate analysis together with LRIG1. Of these factors, younger age (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), lower stage at diagnosis (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), and MCPyV LT expression (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001) were associated with better prognosis, but no prognostic significance was found for MCPyV DNA status (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.064) or gender (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.691). In Cox multivariate analysis (Table 4), for both overall and MCC-specific survival, the factors that exhibited independent statistical significance were age, stage at diagnosis, and MCPyV LT expression (all P values‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ0.012).Table 4 Cox regression multivariate analysis of overall and MCC-specific survivalFull size tableFor CK19, LGR5, and SOX9, no correlation existed between the degree or pattern of expression and patient survival.DiscussionWe found frequent expression of epithelial stem cell markers in MCC. Of note, human Merkel cells have been found to express LRIG1, and SOX9 expression has been observed in Merkel cell progenitors in mice [28, 29]. As such, the expression of epithelial stem cell markers in both MCC and Merkel cells and their progenitors could be explained either by a common ancestor or by MCC indeed developing from Merkel cells. Another possibility that should be entertained is that the expression of epithelial stem cell markers could be induced by MCPyV or otherwise acquired during the oncogenic process, thus mimicking an epithelial stem cell expression pattern. That this is quite a realistic scenario in another context was recently demonstrated by Park et al. who found that MCPyV small T antigen (sTag) was able to turn on the expression of INSM1, a marker of neuroendocrine differentiation, in MCC. Crucially, this INSM1 expression was induced by MCPyV sTag and not by ASCL1 or Phox2b, neither of which are expressed in MCC, as is usually the case in neuroendocrine cells under physiological circumstances [30].It has been a matter of debate whether human Merkel cells are derived from the neural crest or are of epidermal lineage. Murine Merkel cells have been demonstrated to be of epidermal origin [31], and there is substantial evidence suggesting that this is the case in humans as well, including evidence of intraepidermal formation of Merkel cells in xenografts of human fetal skin [28, 32]. The population of Merkel cell progenitors in humans has yet to be thoroughly characterized, and thus, our knowledge of these cells is mainly based on studies done in mice. In mice, stem cells bearing Merkel cell differentiation potential are mainly located in the bulge region and outer root sheet of the hair follicle as well as in touch domes of the interfollicular epidermis [12, 33, 34]. These hair follicle and touch dome stem cells have been found to be the preferential cells of origin in basal cell carcinoma [35]. Basal cell carcinoma has also been shown to express the epithelial stem cell markers CK19, LGR5, LRIG1, and SOX9 [36, 37]. The natural potential of these epithelial stem cells to differentiate into Merkel cells, their sensitivity to oncogenic stimuli such as UV radiation, and the fact that MCC exhibits expression of epithelial stem cell markers known to be expressed in another malignancy that originates from these cells advocates the possibility that they may serve as cells of origin in MCC as well.SOX9 expression and intermediate or strong LGR5 expression were preferentially observed in tumors of sun-exposed localization, and SOX9 expression was associated with the MCPyV-negative subtype. Assuming that MCC can have both an epidermal and a dermal origin as suggested by Sunshine et al. [16], it would be logical to expect tumors of epidermal origin to preferentially arise in sun-exposed locations and be of the MCPyV-negative subtype, seeing as UV radiation is an important oncogenic factor in epidermal malignancies and MCPyV-negative MCC. Alternatively, seeing as SOX9 expression was associated with the MCPyV-negative subtype and LRIG1 expression was associated with the MCPyV-positive subtype, one could speculate that MCPyV-positive and MCPyV-negative MCC has two distinct epithelial ancestries. Acting on the assumption that MCC generally has an epithelial origin, Kervarrec et al. recently suggested the possibility that UV-induced MCC derives from a keratinocytic progenitor from the interfollicular epidermis that acquires the ability to differentiate into Merkel cells during the oncogenic process, whereas MCPyV-driven oncogenesis is initiated in a progenitor from a hair follicle [17].The expression of SOX9 in MCC was recently studied by Kervarrec et al., and nuclear SOX9 expression was found to be more frequent in MCPyV-negative cases, as was the case in this study as well [38]. Dot-like cytoplasmic expression of SOX9 was found in 64%, and nuclear expression was found in 28% of the 103 cases. Contrary to these findings, we only observed nuclear expression of SOX9, representing the active form of this transcription factor, but no dot-like cytoplasmic expression. Of note, different antibody clones for SOX9 were used for the two studies.We observed that dot-like expression of CK19 was more frequent in MCPyV-positive cases. Kervarrec et al. recently found dot-like expression of cytokeratins 8, 18, and 20 to be more frequent in MCPyV-positive MCC [39], and Verhaegen et al. were previously able to induce dot-like expression of cytokeratins 8 and 20 upon ectopic expression of MCPyV sTag in Merkel cells in a transgenic mouse model [40]. Together, these results are suggestive of the capability of MCPyV T antigens to disrupt cytoskeletal organization.We observed that a higher degree of LRIG1 expression was associated with a better overall survival and that any degree of positive LRIG1 expression was associated with a better MCC-specific survival; however, it was not an independent prognostic marker in Cox regression multivariate analyses when age, stage at diagnosis, and MCPyV LT expression were taken into account. We also found a higher degree of LRIG1 expression to be associated with MCPyV LT expression. As such, it is likely that the result of the univariate analysis was mainly due to the association between LRIG1 expression and MCPyV-positive status. It should be mentioned, however, that in the subcohort of 90 patients used for multivariate analyses, there were only eight cases in which LRIG1 expression was absent. LRIG1 is a known tumor suppressor and has been shown to be a positive prognostic marker in other malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma [41,42,43]. LRIG1 is a membrane protein with a transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain. The extracellular domain has receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitory activity, thus suppressing tumor growth by blocking RTK signaling. The ectodomain of LRIG1 has been used as a soluble compound in patient-derived glioblastoma models in vivo with promising results, and the drug resveratrol has been found to inhibit glioma cell growth and promote its apoptosis by upregulating LRIG1 gene expression [44, 45].Interestingly, LRIG1 expression has been found to be associated with favorable prognosis and presence of human papillomavirus DNA in both oropharyngeal cancer and cervical adenocarcinoma. These represent two other examples of a virus-associated malignancy, in which the virus-positive subtype has a better prognosis. In oropharyngeal cancer, with a sample size of 278 patients, LRIG1 expression was also reported to be an independent prognostic marker in Cox regression multivariate analysis, whereas in cervical adenocarcinoma (sample size 86 patients), it was not [46, 47].Seeing as MCPyV status was a statistically more relevant prognostic factor than LRIG1 and there was a correlation between LRIG1- and MCPyV-positivity, we consider MCPyV status to be a more suitable prognostic marker for clinical use and the use of both markers for prognostic purposes to be redundant.In order to prove that a subset of MCC tumors arise from epithelial stem cells, large data sets of for example whole genome sequencing or lineage tracing experiments are necessary. Using large gene expression and methylation data sets, Chteinberg et al. recently found MCC DNA methylation age to be significantly lower than chronological age, indicating a certain degree of stemness of MCC cells; they did not, however, find evidence for pluripotency of MCC cells. [48]It should be noted that there is limited knowledge of the expression of the studied markers in human skin, as most studies to date have been done in mice. Of note, however, in a study by Quist et al., no expression of LGR5 was observed in the interfollicular epidermis, and expression of LRIG1 was limited to the stratum basale, whereas we found expression of both markers throughout the interfollicular epidermis [35]. Indeed, the expression of LGR5 and LRIG1 that we observed in normal human skin was surprisingly widespread. There are, however, numerous examples of stem cell markers that are also commonly expressed in various normal tissues and tissue specificity might vary with antibody clone [49].In summary, we found that MCC expresses several epithelial stem cell markers and that LRIG1 is a positive prognostic marker in MCC.

ABSTRACT 
Despite the close association between Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma (KS) and immune dysfunction, it remains unclear whether tumor infiltrating immune cells (TIIC), by their absence, presence, or dysfunction, are mechanistically correlated with KS pathogenesis. Therefore, their potential capacity to serve as prognostic biomarkers of KS disease progression or control is unclear. Because epidemic-KS (EpKS) occurs with HIV-1 co-infection, it is particularly important to compare TIIC between EpKS and HIV-negative African endemic-KS (EnKS) to dissect the roles of HIV-1 and Kaposi Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) in KS pathogenesis. This cross-sectional study of 13 advanced KS (4 EnKS, 9 EpKS) patients and 3 healthy controls utilized single-color immunohistochemistry and dual-color immunofluorescence assays to characterize and quantify KSHV infected cells in relation to various TIIC in KS biopsies. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Mann-Whitney tests were used to assess differences between groups where P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. The abundance of KSHV infected cells was heterogeneous in KS biopsies. Despite the presence of T-cell chemoattractant chemokine CxCL-9 in biopsies, CD8+ T-cells were sparsely distributed in regions with evident KSHV infected cells but were readily detectable in regions devoid of KSHV infected cells (P < 0.0001). CD68+ (M1) macrophages were evenly and diffusely distributed in KS biopsies, whereas, the majority of CD163+ (M2) macrophages were localized in regions devoid of KSHV infected cells (P < 0.0001). Overall, the poor immune cell infiltration or co-localization in KS biopsies independent of HIV-1 co-infection suggests a fundamental tumor immune evasion mechanism that warrants further investigation.






   Introduction Increased incidence of Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma (KS) in the HIV-1 infected (EpKS), transplant recipients, and in the elderly, implies that immune dysregulation or immune suppression plays a role in tumorigenesis [1, 2]. However, the precise nature of this dysregulation and how it drives KS remains poorly understood. Pathogenetic mechanisms driving African endemic-KS (EnKS), which is responsible for an estimated 4‚Äì10% of African adult cancers [3, 4], are even less clear, since EnKS occurs in both genders as well as children and in the absence of HIV-1 infection or other known immune dysfunctions. Indeed we have shown that KSHV viremia and humoral responses in EnKS show few significant differentials in comparison to those in EpKS [5]. Tumor infiltrating immune cells (TIIC) are indicators of tumor-related immune responses and are therefore often the targets of cancer immunotherapy [6]. For example, CD8+ T-cell infiltration in lung cancer and melanomas has been used as prognostic tool [7, 8]. In addition, tumor infiltration of myeloid lineage cells with a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype is also associated with tumor prognosis. Pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages promote cytotoxic and anti-tumor CD8 and CD4 responses, whereas anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages contribute to Th2 responses, tissues repair and tumor growth [9‚Äì11]. Promoting a switch from the M2 to M1 phenotype in tumors and induction of pro-inflammatory cytotoxic T-cell responses has also been shown to slow or stop cancer growth [12]. Therapeutically, isolation of TIIC, such as T-cells, from tumors, followed by ex vivo expansion, antigenic stimulation and transfer back to the same patient is now a viable treatment strategy in cancers like melanoma and cervical carcinoma [13, 14]. Defining the value of TIIC as cancer prognostic marker is therefore an active area of research for a number of human cancers [7, 15, 16]. Nevertheless, despite the close association between KS and immune dysfunction [5], it remains unclear whether TIIC are a critical component in KS pathogenesis, and whether their absence, presence, or dysregulation could serve as a prognostic biomarker of KS disease progression or control. This is particularly relevant for comparison of EpKS to EnKS where the disease presentation, pathology and humoral immune parameters appear to be highly similar and therefore, the direct or indirect role of HIV-1 in KS remains unclear [5]. Our recent transcriptomic comparison of KS lesions to normal skin from the same individuals, revealed that KS lesions exhibited elevated expression of CxCL-9, CXCL-10 and CXCL-11 [17]. Since these chemokines are known to create chemotactic gradients for T-cell recruitment to sites of infection or loss of homeostasis [18], we asked whether CxCL-9 transcript upregulation was also evident at the protein levels in KS lesions, and if such over-expression correlated with immune cell infiltration into the KS microenvironment. Additionally, because transcriptomics revealed little or no HIV-1 transcription in EpKS lesions (16), we sought to investigate potential indirect effects of HIV-1 immune dysregulation in KS, through comparison of immune cell infiltration between EpKS and EnKS patients. We biopsied EpKS and EnKS patients from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to explore the relationships between chemokine expression, Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-infected cells, TIIC and HIV-1 co-infection. Our study reveals poor immune cell infiltration in most KS tissues and lack of co-localization between TIIC and regions with demonstrable KSHV infection but detected no differentials in immune cell infiltration as a result of HIV-1 co-infection.   Results  Characteristics of study subjects To investigate the relationship between KSHV infected cells and TIIC in KS biopsies, samples with LANA+ cells demonstrable by IHC were utilized. A total of 13 KS cases (4 EnKS and 9 EpKS) and 3 normal skin donors were evaluated for this study. Ages in the cohort ranged from 27 to 84 with a median of 42 years (Table 1). The self-reported duration of KS ranged from 2 months to 3 years at the time of recruitment and was similar between EnKS and EpKS at a median of 6 and 3 months, respectively. EpKS patients were all ART experienced with undetectable plasma HIV-1 load, excepting patient C038 and 21242 who were on ART for less than a month and patient C3097 who was experiencing ART failure. Consistent with the most common presentation of KS in the region [19], most patients had nodular morphotype KS lesions on the extremities (Table 1).

Heterogeneous expression of LANA in KS biopsies To investigate the relationships between KSHV infected cells and TIIC, we first defined ‚Äòinfected cells‚Äô as those evincing a punctate nuclear KSHV LANA staining pattern by IHC [20]. LANA is responsible for maintaining the KSHV episome in infected cells during latency and is also expressed in lytic reactivation [21]. In all KS biopsies, characteristic spindle-morphology cells were evident throughout the biopsy; however, we observed heterogeneous distributions of LANA+ cells. While LANA was not detectable in all spindle cells, some biopsies had a high abundance of LANA+ cells. KS biopsies with medium and low frequency LANA+ cell distributions were also common (Figure 1A).      Figure 1: (A) Representative images showing varying abundancies of Kaposi‚Äôs Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) Latency Associated Nuclear Antigen (LANA) protein on Kaposi‚Äôs Sarcoma (KS) tissues and normal skin by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Representative images at 20√ó and 40√ó magnification are shown for KS tissue with high abundance LANA positive cells ID-21242, medium abundance LANA positive cells ID-21230, low abundance LANA positive cells ID-21229 and normal skin with no LANA positive cells ID-C063-control.

Pink arrow ‚Äì LANA positive and CD34 positive cell, Orange arrow ‚Äì LANA positive and CD34 negative cell.    LANA+ cells in KS biopsies express endothelial cells marker Studies have suggested that the majority of KSHV infected cells in tumors express markers of endothelial cell lineage including CD34 [22, 23]. To confirm the endothelial lineage of KSHV infected cells in the biopsies studied, we utilized DIF staining to simultaneously detect LANA in the nuclei and CD34 on the cell surface. We found that majority of the LANA+ cells in KS biopsies were CD34+ and thus appear to be of endothelial origin, whereas in normal skin, the CD34+ cells were confined to distinct vasculature and LANA was absent. Interestingly, although the majority of LANA+ cells appeared to be endothelial in origin, there were some CD34 negative but LANA+ cells, indicating that other cell types such as fibroblast, epithelial, dendritic and B cells demonstrated to support KSHV infection in vitro may also be present in KS tissues in vivo (Figure 1B) [24‚Äì26].   KS tissues express chemoattractant CxCL-9 Chemokines create chemotactic gradients that can recruit immune cells to the sites of an infection or neoplasia [18]. Expression of T-cell chemoattractants in tissue could suggest an attempt to recruit T-cells to tissue sites. Alternately, these types of chemokines are often produced by myeloid cells that have polarized phenotypes that could be either cancer supportive, cancer repressive or neither. Our recent comparative transcriptomics analysis of KS biopsies versus ipsilateral/contralateral normal skin from the same individual demonstrated that KS lesions express significantly high levels of T-cell chemo-attractants CxCL-9, 10 and 11 compared to normal skin [17]. CxCL-9 was examined instead of CxCL-10 and -11 because it was upregulated the most in KS lesions vs controls skin at false discovery rate (FDR) < 5% [17]. Using DIF co-staining for LANA and CxCL-9, we found that CxCL-9 was indeed expressed at higher levels in both EpKS and EnKS tissue compared to normal skin, consistent with our published transcriptomics analysis [17] (Figure 2). Most CxCL-9 positive cells in KS tissue were LANA- and localized in areas with reduced or undetectable LANA expression. Overall, this suggests that T-cell recruitment into KS is not localized to the KSHV infected regions of both EpKS and EnKS tissues.

Orange arrow ‚Äì CxCL-9 positive cell.    Lack of CD8+ T-cells co-localization with LANA-expressing cells in KS tissues Cytotoxic T-cells are anticipated to migrate into areas of foreign/tumor antigens in response to chemokines, such as CxCL-9 [27, 28]. To investigate CD8+ T-cell infiltration, adjacent tissues sections were IHC stained for LANA and CD8 expression, respectively. Regions with high numbers of LANA+ cells and high CD8+ T-cells on the adjacent slides were identified and statistically compared (Figure 3A). Overall, there were more CD8+ T-cells in KS tissue sections compared to normal skin. There was a lack of co-localization of cells with LANA signal and CD8+ T-cells on the adjacent section from the same tissue biopsy in 12 out of 13 analyzed KS tissues. Although CD8+ T-cells were present, but they were sparsely distributed within LANA+ regions of both EpKS and EnKS tissues (Figure 3A), with the majority found in regions devoid of LANA (P < 0.0001) (Figure 3B). These results were validated with identical findings using a different source of anti-CD8 antibody (Supplementary Figure 1).      Figure 3: Single-color immunohistochemical staining of adjacent KS tissue sections using mouse anti-LANA and mouse anti-humanCD8 antibodies. (A) Representative scanned images at 2√ó and 40√ó magnification for LANA and CD8 staining ID-C3097. Green rectangle ‚Äì LANA positive region of the tissue section, red rectangle ‚Äì CD8+ T-cell region of the tissue section. (B) Quantification plots in LANA+ and CD8+ regions of the adjacent tissues sections.  The use of adjacent tissues sections with traditional single-color IHC to infer co-localization of markers is challenging, as two sequential sections need to be overlaid to determine co-localization. In order to solve this challenge and re-examine the relationship between infected cells and TIIC, we further utilized DIF to stain for LANA and CD8+ T-cells on the same tissue section. Consistent with the IHC results, there was a lack of co-localization of LANA+ cells and CD8+ T-cells on the same section (Figure 4A). While CD8+ T-cells were detectable in LANA+ regions of the tissues, their distribution was sparse and less abundant compared to regions devoid of LANA (P < 0.0001) (Figure 4B). Importantly, the proportions of CD8+ T-cells in LANA+ regions were similar to proportions in normal skin for most tumor biopsies (Supplementary Figure 2). However, CD4+ (Helper T-cells), CD19+ (B-cells) and CD56+ (NK cells) cells were nearly absent in most KS tissues, and when present, were at levels indistinguishable from levels in normal skin tissue (data not shown). Overall, there was lack of co-localization of CD8+, CD4+, B, or NK cells in the vicinity of KSHV infected cells.

To investigate the potential impact of HIV-1 co-infection on TIIC infiltration into KS tissues, we compared staining for CD8, CD4, B, and NK cells between EpKS and EnKS patients. The dearth of CD8+ T-cell infiltration into LANA+ regions of KS biopsies in EpKS was comparable to EnKS (Figure 5) and revealed no differences in the infiltration or co-localization of lymphocytes upon HIV-1 co-infection. Similarly, CD4 T-cells, B, and NK cells were not differential between EpKS and EnKS patients.

CD163 expressing cells are in LANA negative region Tissue resident or infiltrating macrophages can produce chemokines, including CxCL-9, to recruit T-cells to areas with antigens [29]. However, in the tumor microenvironment, macrophages are also known to produce inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species that can induce angiogenesis and promote tumor progression [30‚Äì32]. To investigate the M2/anti-inflammatory macrophage distribution in KS tissues, we evaluated the distribution of CD163, a hemoglobin-haptoglobin acute phase marker which is often correlated with myeloid suppressor phenotypes [33]. While CD163+ myeloid cells were evident in biopsied tissue, the majority were localized in LANA- regions (P = 0.0002) (Figure 6A and 6B). Interestingly, while there were less CD163+ cells in LANA+ regions than other regions for most KS tissues, the number of CD163+ cells in LANA+ regions were significantly higher in EpKS than in EnKS (P = 0.03) (Figure 7A and 7B). This is consistent with increased CD163 levels of expression by the macrophages in HIV-1 infection [34, 35]. However, CD163 expression in biopsy tissue was not different between HIV-1 viremic and aviremic EpKS subjects suggesting that ART is not mitigating the impact of HIV-1 on CD163 upregulation (data not shown). We also evaluated the distribution of lectin/selectin-binding scavenger receptor, CD68 as a marker of infiltration of KS tissue by M1/inflammatory macrophages. Cells expressing CD68 were randomly distributed in KS tissues and were not significantly different between LANA+ or LANA- regions (Figure 8). Likewise, no differences between EnKS and EpKS in CD68+ cell distribution was evident (Figure 9). However, the ratio of CD68 to CD163 cells was significantly higher in LANA+ regions compared to LANA- regions of KS biopsies (Figure 10). Taken together, macrophages in KS tissues do not specifically localize with or target the KSHV infected cells. Moreover, the distribution of myeloid/macrophage cells in KS does not appear to reflect HIV-1 co-infection status or control of HIV-1 viremia.

DISCUSSION This is the first study to investigate spatial relationships between chemokine expression, immune cell infiltration and KSHV infected cells in EpKS and EnKS tumor tissues from SSA. Our analysis found that in both EpKS and EnKS, the abundance and distribution of LANA+ cells varies widely between KS biopsies even though most of the patients in this cohort had nodular KS lesions. Consistent with expression of the known T-cell chemoattractant, CxCL-9, in the KS tissues, there were more CD8+ T-cells in KS tissue sections compared to normal skin; however, it was notable that those T-cells did not co-localize with KSHV infected cells. CD8+ T-cells play a major role in tumor and intracellular infection control through their capacity to kill infected or cancer cells in response to recognition of class I presented peptides indicative of loss of cellular homeostasis [36]. Immunosuppression induced by the tumor microenvironment can lead to dysfunctional CD8+ T-cells and tumor progression [37]. In solid tumors, CD8+ T-cell-mediated antitumor activity can be hindered by inhibitory cytokines, altered metabolism, expression of immune checkpoint molecules, abnormal tumor angiogenesis, myelosuppressive cells or regulatory T-cells (Tregs), acting alone or in combination [37, 38]. In KS, Tregs have been suggested to regulate CD8+ T-cells [39]. To evaluate which of these potential mechanisms might be contributory to KS pathogenesis, we have initially evaluated markers and cell types that were found to be elevated in our KS transcriptomics analysis that compared KS tissue to contralateral skin from the same subjects [17]. That study suggested over-expression of T-cell chemoattractant genes and those indicative of immune cell infiltration coupled to a Warburg-like metabolic pattern. Quantification of the extent of CD8+ T-cell infiltration into KS tissues revealed a distribution that was limited mainly to areas devoid of KSHV LANA+ cells. This was surprising, since the T-cell chemoattractant, CxCL-9, was demonstrated to be elevated at the protein level in KS tissues sections compared to normal skin. Importantly, other T-cell chemoattractants, CxCL-10 and 11 transcripts were also overexpressed in KS lesions compared to controls [17], but we have not yet attempted detection of those proteins in tissue. While CD8+ T-cells were clearly present in the vicinity of KS tumor tissue in excess of the numbers in normal skin, it is possible that recruited CD8+ T-cells undergo inhibition from exposure to the cytokines produced by the tumor cells like IL-10 and TGF-Œ≤, that may impede access to the tumor parenchyma [17, 38]. Like other herpesviruses, KSHV is known to downregulate MHC class I antigen presentation and T-cell co-stimulation molecules CD86 and ICAM [40, 41]. Through viral encoded K3 and K5, KSHV escapes detection by cytotoxic T-cells and NK cells [42, 43]. vIRF3 also downregulates MHC class II by degrading interferon-Œ≥ produced by NK cells [44]. It is possible that the lack of T-cell co-localization with KSHV infected cells in KS tumors is a result of KSHV downregulation of interferon responses and antigen presentation. The lack of co-localization could also be due to the lack of T-cell repertoire against KSHV in the T-cells that chemotactically locate the infected cells in the KS tumor. Studies of circulating T-cell Ag-specific function suggest lack of immunodominance against KSHV antigens in either KS or asymptomatic patients. Although some T-cell repertoire against KSHV has been reported, most of these responses were weak and variable in different individuals [45, 46]. It is also possible that the viral peptides presented by Class I on the KS tumors are decoupled from T-cell repertoire recognition, thereby shielding the antigens from the immune systems. This is currently under investigation. KSHV is known to induce hypoxic metabolic derangements through HIF-1 expression [47]. The induced metabolic dysfunctions, including Warburg-like metabolism, could result in lactate production. The resultant hypoxic and acidic tumor environment could be non-conducive for T-cell infiltration leading to restriction of CD8+ T-cells access. Although, it appears unlikely given the progressive nature of KS disease, it is also possible that LANA+ cells were previously targeted and killed by CD8+ T-cells in regions exhibiting enriched T-cells but devoid of LANA+ cells. However, T-cells in these focal areas would have to have become exhausted and unable to proliferate and infiltrate the rest of the tumor [48]. Further studies will be needed to address the immunophenotypes, functionality and KSHV specificity of the CD8+ T-cells and other immune cells from the immune cell infiltrates in KS biopsies. Analysis of MHC class I peptides presented on KS tumors is also important in order to rule out mismatch between T-cell repertoire and Ag presentation repertoire. Macrophages detect, engulf and destroy invading microorganisms and infected cells [31, 49]. During tumor progression, tumor cells induce maladaptive macrophage phenotypes through metabolic reprogramming [50]. The maladapted macrophages create an immunosuppressive niche leading to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance [51]. Cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-Œ≤ are known to polarize macrophages into the M2 phenotype that is associated with immunosuppression [9, 30, 52]. Interestingly our previous study has shown that IL-6, IL-10, IL-5 and TGF-Œ≤ were elevated in KS patients compared to asymptomatic controls [5]. These cytokines were also associated with increased antibody responses that are not protective against KS [5]. High levels of macrophages in KS biopsies could be responsible for creating an immunosuppressive niche that restricts CD8+ T-cell infiltration and enhance tumor growth. Overall, it appears that macrophages in KS tumors support KS progression. However, investigation of different macrophage phenotypes and their specific functions in KS biopsies is needed to understand the role of TIIC in KS. This study initiated the investigation of TIIC in KS biopsies in order to understand the role of TIIC in KS. Overall, there is poor immune cell infiltration or co-localization in LANA+ regions of KS biopsies. The apparent lack of immune cell co-localization with KSHV infected cells for both EpKS and EnKS suggests that HIV-1 does not significantly influence immune cell infiltration in KS biopsies. However, the size of the cohort, the formalin-fixed treatment of the samples as well as the limited tumor and control tissue quantity, have reduced the depth of our investigations. Studies with larger sample sizes patients will be needed to address gaps highlighted in this study. Whether TIICs in KS are functional and match presented peptides in the tumor also need to be further investigated with freshly collected tissue. Correlation between TIIC abundance and treatment outcomes of KS could be useful in defining the role of TIIC as a prognostic marker of KS.   Materials and Methods  Study design, subjects and samples This cross-sectional study recruited 16 participants (4 EnKS, 9 EpKS KS patients and 3 controls without KS) from Tanzania and Zambia. Participants were of both genders and over 18 years old. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. KS was diagnosed by both histology and immunohistochemistry for KSHV latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA). Peripheral blood samples about 10 mL were collected, plasma was isolated and used for HIV-1 viral load quantification by real-time PCR. A 4 mm KS biopsy was taken from each subject, fixed in neutral buffered formalin, and processed into a paraffin-embedded block for KS histological diagnosis, LANA IHC and subsequent immunofluorescence staining. This study was approved by the review boards of Tanzania National Institute for Medical Research, Ocean Road Cancer Institute, University of Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL).   HIV-1 serology and plasma viral load quantification by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) HIV-1 serology was determined by point-of-care serology and plasma viral load by quantitative RT-PCR as previously described [5]. Briefly, HIV-1 screening was done using HIV Rapid Test Algorithm in Tanzania or Alere Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo test in Zambia [53]. Viral RNA was extracted from plasma according to the QIAamp viral RNA extraction protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The viral copy numbers were then determined using RNA Ultra-Sense One-Step quantitative RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) as previously described with universal HIV LTR primers [54] (forward [5‚Ä≤-GCCTCAATAAAGCTTGCCTTGA-3‚Ä≤] and reverse [5‚Ä≤‚ÄìGGGCGCCACTGCTAGAGA‚Äì3‚Ä≤] and probe [5‚Ä≤-FAM/CCAGAGTCACACAACAGACGGGCACA/-BHQ1-3‚Ä≤]) under the following conditions: 50¬∞C for 15 min, 95¬∞C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95¬∞C for 15 seconds, and 60¬∞C for 30 seconds.   Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and cell quantification Adjacent 6 Œºm-thick sections of paraffin-embedded KS tissues were used for IHC, as previously described [55]. Mouse anti-LANA antibody clone NCL-L-HHV8-LNA (1:100) (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK), anti-human CD8 clone C8/144B (1:100) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) or anti-human CD8 clone 4B11 (1:40) (GeneTex, Irvine, CA) were used as primary antibodies. Normal mouse IgG (Dako √ó0931, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) was used as an isotype control at identical concentration. To quantify the number of positive cells for a specific cell surface marker of interest, all IHC stained slides were digitally scanned on a MoticEasyScan One (Motic, San Antonio, TX) at 40 √ó. On each anti-LANA stained slide, five regions of about 50 Œºm2 were selected in regions with high abundance of LANA. The total number of cells and LANA+ cells were then quantified using Fiji software (NIH). The same procedure was applied to anti-CD8 stained slides and CD8+ cells were counted. The five high LANA regions were then identified on corresponding CD8 stained slides and the total number of cells and CD8+ T-cells were counted. Reciprocally, the five high CD8+ regions were then identified on corresponding LANA stained slides and the total number of cells and LANA+ cells were counted. Average number of total cells and marker-delineated cells in the five regions were used to calculate proportions of specific markers in an area of high LANA or high CD8+ T-cells on adjacent tissue sections. Percentages of specific markers were then calculated and plotted using GraphPad Prism v.5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).   Dual-Color Immunofluorescence (DIF) Adjacent 6 Œºm-thick sections of paraffin-embedded KS tissues were processed following the IHC protocol with modifications. After antigen retrieval, the sections were incubated with 0.3M glycine for 30 min at room temperature to minimize tissue auto-fluorescence and Tris-NaCl blocking buffer (PerkinElmer FP1020, Boston, MA) was used as blocking solution. For DIF, a rat anti-LANA antibody clone LN35 at 1:100 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was used together with one of the following primary mouse monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD8 clone C8/144B (1:100), anti-CD4 clone 4B12 (1:100), anti CD34 clone QBEnd10 (1:50), anti-CD68 clone KP1 (1:100), CD19 clone LE-CD19 and anti-CD56 clone 123C3 (1:100) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and anti-CD163 clone10D6 (1:100) (Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO) or goat polyclonal anti-CxCL-9/MIG clone AF392 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN). The primary antibodies were diluted in TNB blocking buffer and incubated at 4¬∞C overnight in a humidity chamber. Sections were equilibrated to room temperature, rinsed in 1√ó PBS-0.05% Tween-20 and then incubated with secondary antibodies Alexa 488-Donkey anti-rat A21208 together with either Alexa 647-Donkey anti-mouse A31571 (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) or Alexa 647-Donkey anti-goat A32849, Invitrogen, Rockford IL) for 2 hours at room temperature in a humidity chamber. Nucleus counterstaining was performed with 300 nM 4‚Äô,6-Diamino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride (DAPI) solution (Invitrogen D1306, Eugene OR) for 30 minutes before mounting coverslip with Fluoro-gel (# 17985-10, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield PA). To determine lineage of the KSHV infected cells in the KS tumors, endothelial cell marker CD34 was utilized, consistent with other literature on KS where CD34 has been utilized to demonstrate endothelial lineage [22, 23].   Confocal microscopy and cell quantification All sections were imaged with Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal system mounted on Nikon Ti2 inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY). Nuclei stained with DAPI were excited at 405 nm wavelength and emission was collected between 425‚Äì475 nm wavelengths. Alexa 488 stained LANA was excited at 488 nm wavelength and emission was collected between 500‚Äì550nm wavelengths. All other surface markers were stained with Alexa 647, and excited at 640 nm with emission collection between 663‚Äì738 nm wavelengths. Images were acquired with NIS elements software (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) using sequential scanning (channel series) and Z-stacking (Z-series) of 1 Œºm slices at 60√ó magnification. Settings for laser power, detector gain and offset for individual markers were unchanged between slides. LANA positive (+) and negative (‚Äì) regions were identified in the same tissue and three representative regions with maximum signal (LANA and surface marker) were selected and imaged. Fiji software (NIH) was used on maximum image projections (MaxIP) to quantify the total number of cells, and cells with specific marker enumeration. The average of total number of cells and cells with specific markers in the three regions was used to calculate proportions of specific markers in an area of high LANA and in a region with high CD8+ T-cells. Percentages of specific markers were then calculated and plotted using GraphPad Prism v.5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).   Statistical analysis Cell surface marker expression was compared between KS tissues and normal skin, between KSHV LANA (+) and (‚Äì) regions of the same section or between adjacent sections and between EpKS and EnKS patients. At least 3 sections per tissue were evaluated for all 16 tissue samples. 3 to 5 regions per tissue section were quantified and the average number of cells was used for statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and non-parametric Mann-Whitney test using GraphPad Prism v.5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). All tests were 2-tailed, and P-values < 0.05 were considered significant.

AbstractKaposi‚Äôs sarcoma‚Äìassociated herpesvirus (KSHV), which belongs to the gammaherpesvirus subfamily, is associated with the pathogenesis of various tumors. Nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) catalyzes the polymerization of ADP-ribose units on target proteins. In KSHV-infected cells, PARP1 inhibits replication and transcription activator (RTA), a molecular switch that initiates lytic replication, through direct interaction. Thus, for efficient replication, KSHV has to overcome the molecular barrier in the form of PARP1. Previously, we have demonstrated that KSHV downregulates the expression of PARP1 through PF-8, a viral processivity factor. PF-8 induces ubiquitin‚Äìproteasome system‚Äìmediated degradation of PARP1 via direct physical association and enhances RTA transactivation activity. Here, we showed that dimerization domains of PF-8 are crucial not only for PARP1 interaction and degradation but also for enhancement of the RTA transactivation activity. PF-8 recruited CHFR for the PARP1 degradation. A knockdown of CHFR attenuated the PF-8‚Äìinduced PARP1 degradation and enhancement of the RTA transactivation activity, leading to reduced KSHV lytic replication. These findings reveal a mechanism by which KSHV PF-8 recruits a cellular E3 ligase to curtail the inhibitory effect of PARP1 on KSHV lytic replication.

Author summary
Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma‚Äìassociated herpesvirus (KSHV), a member of the gammaherpesvirus subfamily, is associated with the pathogenesis of various tumors. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), which is involved in various cellular functions, restricts lytic replication of oncogenic gammaherpesviruses by inhibiting replication and transcription activator (RTA), a molecular switch that activates the viral lytic replication. To abrogate the inhibitory effect of PARP1, reactivated KSHV promotes PARP1 degradation via direct interaction between PARP1 and PF-8, a viral processivity factor. Dimerization domains of PF-8 were found to be critical for PARP1 interaction and degradation and for enhancing the RTA transactivation activity. Furthermore, we found that CHFR, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is required for PF-8‚Äìinduced PARP1 degradation and efficient lytic replication of KSHV. This is the first study to show the role of CHFR in viral replication or pathogenicity. This study revealed a molecular mechanism via which gammaherpesviruses overcome the PARP1-mediated inhibitory effect on viral replication: by means of PF-8, which recruits a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase.

IntroductionHuman gammaherpesviruses, including the Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus and Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma‚Äìassociated herpesvirus (KSHV), which mainly establish a latent infection in lymphocytes, are associated with the pathogenesis of various tumors and proliferative diseases. The latent KSHV infection is associated with all types of Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman‚Äôs disease [1,2]. In addition to the KSHV latent infection, the reactivation of latent KSHV and lytic replication are critical for virus propagation and spread. The viral reactivation replenishes a pool of latently infected cells and contributes to tumorigenesis. The population of episome-harboring cells diminishes during cell division if the latent virus is not periodically reactivated [3,4]. Therefore, the inhibition of KSHV lytic replication is important for the control of viral infection and tumorigenesis.
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a nuclear enzyme that catalyzes the polymerization of ADP-ribose monomers (derived from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NAD+) on a target protein. PARP1 is involved in various cellular processes, such as the DNA damage response, cell death, chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation, inflammation, and tumorigenesis [5]. In KSHV-infected cells, PARP1 catalyzes the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) of replication and transcription activator (RTA), a molecular switch of lytic replication through direct interaction, which inhibits the RTA activity and consequently suppresses lytic replication [6,7]. Additionally, PARP1 modulates DNA replication of KSHV [8,9].
Previously, we have reported a strategy that the virus uses to overcome the inhibitory effect of PARP1 during KSHV lytic replication [10]. The reactivation of KSHV results in PARP1 downregulation. The direct interaction between PF-8, a viral processivity factor encoded by the KSHV orf59 gene, and PARP1 causes ubiquitin‚Äìproteasome system (UPS)-dependent degradation of PARP1. The PF-8‚Äìmediated PARP1 degradation enhances the RTA transactivation activity and promotes lytic replication [10]. Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying the PF-8‚Äìinduced PARP1 degradation has not been elucidated. PF-8 does not contain any known motif that mediates protein degradation. In this study, we mapped the critical domains involved in the interaction between PF-8 and PARP1. Furthermore, a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase recruited by PF-8 for the PARP1 degradation was identified. Our work elucidates the mechanism through which the virus overcomes the host barrier against efficient lytic replication, which involves hijacking the cellular UPS.

PF-8‚Äìinduced PARP1 degradation through K48-mediated poly-ubiquitination
Previously, we have demonstrated that PF-8, a processivity factor of KSHV, induces UPS-dependent degradation of PARP1 via a direct association upon reactivation of latently infected B cells [10]. In the present study, the iSLK.219 cell line, a subclone of iSLK cells that are latently infected with recombinant KSHV.219, was used. iSLK.219 cells emit a green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal during latency and a red-fluorescent-protein signal upon doxycycline (DOX)-induced reactivation of the virus [11]. When PF-8 was knocked down in iSLK.219 cells (Fig 1A), PARP1 levels did not diminish, whereas the expression of viral lytic genes including RTA, PAN RNA and K8, decreased, indicating that PF-8 is necessary to degrade PARP1 and promote viral reactivation (Fig 1A‚Äì1D). Results of a PARP1 immunoprecipitation (IP) assay in PF-8‚Äìtransfected cells revealed that endogenous PARP1 interacted with PF-8, which promoted the degradation of PARP1 through K48-mediated poly-ubiquitination (Fig 1E). In KSHV replicating BC-3 cells, PARP1 was also degraded and co-localized with PF-8 in the nucleus (Fig 1F). KSHV reactivation decreased the PARP1 protein level in BC-3 cells via inducing PARP1 polyubiquitination in BC-3 cells (Fig 1G). These data indicated that PF-8 promotes PARP1 degradation through a ubiquitination-dependent mechanism and consequently facilitates viral lytic replication.

Identification of PARP1 domain required for PF-8 interaction
To identify the domain involved in the PARP1‚ÄìPF-8 interaction, we conducted experiments with PARP1 domain mutants. PARP1 comprises the following three domains: a DNA-binding domain, an automodification domain (AD) with a BRCA1 C-terminus (BRCT) motif (which mediates auto-PARylation and protein‚Äìprotein interactions), and a catalytic domain for PARylation (CAT; Fig 2A) [12‚Äì14]. HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged PARP1 domain mutants and MYC-tagged PF-8 to analyze the protein interactions by the IP assay. PF-8 coimmunoprecipitated with full-length PARP1 and the AD, not with DBD or CAT (Fig 2B). In addition, a PARP1 mutant with AD deletion (ŒîAD) failed to interact with PF-8, indicating that the AD of PARP1 is necessary and sufficient in the association of PF-8 with PARP1 (Fig 2C).

Mapping the PF-8 domains critical for PARP1 interaction and degradation
To map the domain of PF-8 that mediates the PARP1 interaction and subsequent PARP1 degradation, we constructed the following domain deletion mutants: PF-8 ŒîN, PF-8 ŒîI, and PF-8 ŒîC (Fig 3A). Some studies suggest that mutant proteins PF-8 ŒîN and PF-8 ŒîI lack the domains necessary for PF-8 dimerization (amino acid residues [aa] 1‚Äì23 and 277‚Äì304) and for viral DNA polymerase interaction (aa 1‚Äì27 and 277‚Äì304) [15‚Äì19], and that the PF-8 ŒîC mutant protein lacks the region of the nuclear localization signal (aa 369‚Äì377) and an unstructured motif [16]. Consistent with the results of previous studies, the PF-8 ŒîN and PF-8 ŒîI mutants, but not PF-8 ŒîC mutant, did not dimerize in HEK293T cells (Fig 3B). Although PF-8 ŒîN and PF-8 ŒîI showed nuclear localization, the degradation of PARP1 was not observed in either the PF-8 ŒîN‚Äìtransfected or PF-8 ŒîI‚Äìtransfected HEK293T cells and HeLa cells (Fig 3C and 3D). In contrast, the degradation of PARP1 was observed in the PF-8 ŒîC‚Äìtransfected cells (Fig 3C and 3D). The change in the subcellular localization from the nucleus alone to both the nucleus and the cytosol after PF-8 was truncated (the PF-8 ŒîC mutant) indicated that the deletion of 26 aa from the C terminus of PF-8 was not sufficient to block the nuclear transport of this protein, in contradiction to the results of another study (Fig 3D) [16]. The degradation, interaction, and poly-ubiquitination of PARP1 were defective in the PF-8 ŒîN‚Äìtransfected and PF-8 ŒîI‚Äìtransfected HEK293T cells, whereas these characteristics were similar between the PF-8 ŒîC‚Äìtransfected and wild-type (WT) PF-8‚Äìtransfected HEK293T cells (Fig 3E). These findings suggest that the domains participating in PF-8 dimerization are essential for the PARP1 interaction and ubiquitination-dependent degradation.

Dimerization domains of PF-8 are essential for the enhancement of RTA transactivation
PF-8‚Äìmediated PARP1 degradation is reported to promote the RTA transactivation activity [10]. Therefore, we set to determine the PF-8 domain that is involved in the enhancement of the RTA transactivation activity. In reporter assays with RTA (kRp-luc) and polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) RNA (pPAN-luc) promoters [20,21], mutants MYC-PF-8 ŒîN and MYC-PF-8 ŒîI did not enhance RTA-mediated transactivation (Fig 4A and 4B). On the contrary, the RTA-mediated transactivation activities in the MYC-PF8 ŒîC‚Äìtransfected cells were similar to those in the MYC-PF8 WT‚Äìtransfected cells. The impact of PF-8‚Äìinduced PARP1 degradation on the enzymatic activity of PARP1 was evaluated by means of the HEK293T cells expressing either WT or mutant PF-8 (Fig 4C). The activity of PARP1 was lower in the WT PF-8‚Äìtransfected and PF-8 ŒîC‚Äìtransfected cells; however, the activity of PARP1 in the PF-8 ŒîN‚Äìtransfected and PF-8 ŒîI‚Äìtransfected cells was similar to that in the control vector‚Äìtransfected cells. In agreement with these results, the PARylation of RTA in the WT PF-8‚Äìtransfected and PF-8 ŒîC‚Äìtransfected cells was significantly weaker when compared with the control vector‚Äìtransfected, PF-8 ŒîN‚Äìtransfected, or PF-8 ŒîI‚Äìtransfected cells (Fig 4D). In contrast, PF-8 ŒîN and PF-8 ŒîI were capable of interacting with RTA, whereas PF-8 ŒîC did not interact with RTA (Fig 4D). These findings suggest that the interaction between PF-8 and RTA may not be essential for PF-8‚Äìinduced degradation of PARP1 and enhancement of the RTA activity. These results indicated that the dimerization domains (aa 1‚Äì27 and 277‚Äì304) of PF-8 are crucial to enhance RTA transactivation through the induction of PARP1 degradation, which attenuates PARP1 enzymatic activities.

PF-8 interacts with cellular E3 ubiquitin ligases to target PARP1 for degradation
An analysis of PF-8 structure revealed that there is no known motif related to protein degradation, suggesting that PF-8 may recruit an additional cellular factor for PARP1 degradation [22]. We hypothesized that an E3 ubiquitin ligase is recruited by PF-8 to degrade PARP1. To test this hypothesis, we examined the cellular E3 ubiquitin ligases that are reported to interact with and ubiquitinate PARP1, e.g., checkpoint with FHA and RING finger domains (CHFR), ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1 (UHRF1), ring finger protein 144A (RNF144A), and RNF146 (also known as Iduna) [23‚Äì26] (S1 Fig). A co-IP analysis revealed that among these E3 ubiquitin ligases, CHFR and UHRF1 interacted with PF-8 (Fig 5A). PARP1 levels in cells cotransfected with PF-8 and either CHFR or UHRF1 were lower than those in cells transfected with PF-8, CHFR, or UHRF1 alone. The interactions between PF-8 and endogenous CHFR or UHRF1 were confirmed using cell lines BC-3 and SLK (endothelial-like cells) stably expressing FLAG-tagged PF-8 (Fig 5B and 5C). These data indicated that PF-8 interacts with PARP1-ubiquitinating E3 ligases: CHFR and UHRF1.

CHFR is required for PF-8‚Äìinduced PARP1 degradation and poly-ubiquitination
The role of these two E3 ubiquitin ligases in PF-8‚Äìinduced PARP1 degradation was evaluated using either CHFR or UHRF1 knockdown HEK293T cells (shCHFR or shUHRF1) as well as control cells (shCtrl cells; Fig 6A and 6B). shCHFR cells did not exhibit PF-8‚Äìmediated PARP1 degradation, which was detectable in shCtrl cells, while PF-8‚Äìmediated PARP1 degradation levels in shUHRF1 cells were similar to those in shCtrl cells (Fig 6C). Consistent with these results, shCHFR cells showed attenuation of PF-8‚Äìinduced poly-ubiquitination of PARP1; this effect was not observed in shUHRF1 cells (Fig 6D). It was also noted that PF-8 could bind to PARP1 even in the absence of CHFR or UHRF1 (Fig 6D). These results indicated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHFR takes part in PF-8‚Äìinduced degradation and poly-ubiquitination of PARP1 through physical association.

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009261.g006Next, we characterized the interactions between PF-8 and CHFR. In line with the results of co-IP, MYC-tagged-PF-8‚Äìtransfected HeLa cells showed nuclear colocalization of the PF-8 protein and endogenous CHFR (Fig 7A). Endogenous CHFR was co-localized with PF-8 in the nucleus of KSHV-replicating BC-3 cells (Fig 7B). The domains of PF-8 required for CHFR interactions in the transfected HEK293T cells were mapped using the PF-8 mutant constructs. The co-IP results revealed little or no interaction between CHFR and either PF-8 ŒîN or PF-8 ŒîI. Nonetheless, the interaction between PF-8 ŒîC and CHFR was intact and was similar to that between PF-8 WT and CHFR (Fig 7C). The PF-8 domains required for the CHFR interaction turned out to be similar to those required for the PARP1 interaction. Hence, we hypothesized that PARP1 may be required for the interactions of PF-8 with CHFR. The shCtrl and shPARP1 cells were transfected with MYC-tagged PF-8. Results from co-IP assays revealed that PF-8 interacted with CHFR in both shCtrl and shPARP1 cells, suggesting that the PF-8‚Äìmediated CHFR recruitment was not dependent on PARP1 (Fig 7D). Next, we examined whether PF-8 recruits CHFR, which in turn increases the interaction between PARP1 and CHFR. Given that endogenous and transfected CHFR can target PARP1 for degradation, we conducted co-IP assays of PARP1 in shCHFR cells trans-complemented with CHFR I306A, a catalytic mutant of CHFR defective in E3 Ub-ligase activity [27]. Results showed that PF-8 increased the interaction between CHFR I306A and PARP1 (Fig 7E). These data suggested that CHFR is recruited by PF-8 to target PARP1 for protein degradation via direct physical interactions.

CHFR is essential for PF-8‚Äìmediated enhancement of RTA transactivation activity
To further investigate the participation of CHFR in the PF-8‚Äìmediated enhancement of the RTA transactivation activity, reporter assays were conducted with RTA and PAN promoters. PF-8 did not enhance the RTA-mediated transactivation of both RTA and PAN promoters in shCHFR cells compared to that in control cells (Fig 8A and 8B). On the contrary, the PF-8‚Äìinduced RTA-mediated transactivation in shUHRF1 cells was similar to that in shCtrl cells (S2A and S2B Fig). Moreover, the overexpression of CHFR dose-dependently increased RTA transactivation of RTA and PAN promoters in the presence of PF-8 (Fig 8C and 8D). In the absence of PF-8, the effect of CHFR on RTA transactivation was marginal, albeit statistically significant, suggesting that PF-8 recruitment of CHFR to PARP1 is critical for enhancement of RTA transactivation.

CHFR is essential for efficient lytic replication of KSHV
Next, we examined the role of CHFR on KSHV lytic replication in BC-3 cells. The KSHV reactivation did not induce PARP1 degradation in shCHFR BC-3 cells, but did so in shCtrl BC-3 cells generated (Fig 9A). The expressions of KSHV lytic proteins (RTA and K8) and transcripts (RTA and PAN RNA) were lower in shCHFR BC-3 cells than in shCtrl BC-3 cells following viral reactivation (Fig 9A‚Äì9C). The shCHFR BC-3 cells also produced the lower level of virion, as shown in viral genome copy from the culture supernatants (Fig 9D). The results from shCHFR iSLK.219 cells were consistent with those in shCHFR BC-3 cells (Fig 9E‚Äì9H). From shCHFR iSLK.219 cells, the culture supernatants were transferred to uninfected HEK293 cells and counted for the GFP (+) cells (Fig 9I). shCHFR iSLK.219 cells produced the lower amount of virion than shCtrl iSLK.219 cells. Taken together, these data indicate that CHFR is critical for efficient lytic replication of KSHV. Because CHFR was implicated in the PF-8‚Äìinduced PARP1 degradation, we also examined the expression of CHFR after the viral reactivation. The CHFR level was not significantly affected by the KSHV reactivation in both iSLK.219 cells and BC-3 cells (S3 Fig).

At 24 h after TPA treatment, the lysates of shCtrl cells and shCHFR cells were processed for western blotting with the anti-PARP1, anti-CHFR, anti-RTA, anti-K8, and anti-Œ±-tubulin antibodies (A). The protein levels of RTA or K8 relative to those of Œ±-tubulin are indicated. The relative transcript levels of RTA (B) and PAN RNA (C) were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The viral DNA genome copy number in supernatants was quantified by qPCR using primers against PF-8 (D).

At 48 h after DOX treatment, the lysates of shCtrl iSLK.219 cells and shCHFR iSLK.219 cells were processed for western blotting as described in A (E). The relative transcript levels of RTA (F) and PAN RNA (G) were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Viral DNA genome copy number in supernatants harvested from iSLK.219 cells was quantified by qPCR using primers against PF-8 (H). The supernatants of the iSLK.219 cells were transferred to infect HEK293T cells. After 2 days, the number of GFP-positive HEK293T cells was analyzed using FACS to deduce titer of produced virion from induced iSLK.219 cells (I).

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009261.g009These findings suggested that cellular CHFR recruited by viral PF-8 is essential for the PF-8‚Äìinduced degradation of PARP1 and enhanced RTA transactivation activity, which promotes efficient lytic replication of KSHV.


DiscussionIn this study, we investigated the mechanism behind the attenuation (by a viral processivity factor, PF-8) of the negative regulatory effect of host PARP1 on KSHV lytic replication. A cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase (CHFR) that was recruited by PF-8 to facilitate lytic replication was identified. PARP1 is involved in diverse cellular pathways, including DNA damage response, cell death, proliferation, differentiation, gene transcription, and inflammation [5,14,28,29]. Additionally, PARP1 plays a key part in various viral infections, such as retrovirus, hepatitis B virus, and herpesvirus infections [28,30‚Äì37]. PARP1 exerts its inhibitory action on KSHV lytic replication by PARylating RTA and thereby inhibiting the transactivation activity of RTA [6,7,9,38,39]. PARP1, which is recruited to the terminal repeats of the KSHV genome, PARylates latency associated-nuclear antigen (LANA) to increase the latent viral genome copy number [8]. PARP1 can be a double-edged sword for the KSHV replication cycle; PARP1 positively regulates oriLyt-dependent DNA replication of KSHV, but suppresses the expression of genes partaking in the lytic replication cycle. Nonetheless, overall effects of these PARP1-mediated regulatory mechanisms decrease the production of infectious virions [9].
KSHV is believed to utilize two strategies to counter the inhibitory effect of PARP1 on lytic replication. In the first strategy, the orf49-encoded tegument protein, vPIP, sequesters PARP1 from RTA through direct interaction [40,41]. A similar strategy is used by the hepatitis B virus with the X protein [40‚Äì42]. Alternatively, the orf59-encoded viral processivity factor, PF-8, induces PARP1 degradation and promotes RTA-mediated transactivation [10]. Compared to other viral factors that are known to modulate the PARP1 activity via direct association [40‚Äì42], PF-8 is unique in that it decreases the PARP1 activity by degrading PARP1. The viral processivity factor PF-8 usually assists viral DNA polymerase during genome replication. On the contrary, the role and mechanism of action of PF-8, which has no known motif for engagement of the UPS to induce protein degradation, have not been elucidated until our study.
Given that PARP1 acts as an important component of DNA damage response, PF-8-induced PARP1 degradation may be an indirect effect through DNA damage response pathways. We checked the DNA damage response in HEK293T cells expressing PF-8 by observing phosphorylation of H2AX (Œ≥H2AX) and 53BP1 recruitment [43]. PF-8 alone neither induced phosphorylation of H2AX nor changed 53BP1 localization (S4A and S4B Fig). In addition, treatment with an ATM inhibitor (KU55933) did not affect PF-8-mediated PARP1 degradation and interaction between PF-8 and PARP1 (S4C Fig). These results suggest that PF-8‚Äìinduced PARP1 degradation via physical association is unlikely due to an indirect effect of PARP1 through activation of DNA damage response pathways. In contrast, PF-8‚Äìmediated PARP1 degradation may affect the recruitment of DNA damage repair machinery during lytic replication. Hollingworth et al. reported that nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair proteins such as Ku80 and DNA-PK restricted KSHV lytic replication [44]. PARP1 recruits Ku80 on double-strand breaks (DSB) and facilitates DSB repair and PF-8 blocks interaction between Ku70/80 and DNA-PKcs [45], thereby inhibiting NHEJ, it is plausible to think that PF-8‚Äìmediated PARP1 degradation may ameliorate the suppressive effect of NHEJ components, Ku80 and DNA-PKcs on virus replication.
Various studies suggest that viruses employ the host UPS to overcome host barriers to viral infection [46,47]. KSHV utilizes viral proteins as E3 ubiquitin ligases to recruit some components of the UPS to promote own replication [48‚Äì51]. In lytic replication, E3 ligase proteins K3 and K5, members of the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) family, reduce the expression of cell surface molecules, including MHC-I, ICAM-I, B7.2, CD83, and CD4, to evade host immune surveillance [48‚Äì51]. RTA functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and causes degradation of cellular repressors, such as K-RBP, Hey1, and interferon-regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), to promote lytic replication [52‚Äì54]. During latency, KSHV-encoded LANA recruits the EC5S ubiquitin complex to degrade tumor suppressor proteins, such as p53 and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), and thus may facilitate tumorigenesis [55]. Recently, LANA was also reported to physically associate with a cellular E3 ligase, RLIM (RING finger LIM-domain-interacting protein), and to induce its autoubiquitination for its degradation [56]. Although a liquid chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry study [57] and our unpublished proteomic studies on the PF-8 interactome have not revealed any interacting E3 ligases, our current findings indicate that a viral factor engages the host UPS to degrade a cellular protein. Among PARP1 poly-ubiquitinating E3 ligases, CHFR and UHRF1 were found to interact with PF-8 (Fig 4). Our IFA results for transfected MYC-PF-8 and virus-encoded PF-8 in BC-3 cells showed co-localization of PARP1, CHFR and PF-8. If possible, an assay for in situ detection of endogenous protein interaction like proximity ligation assay would give more supportive results to validate their interaction. Although IFA showed PF-8 from KSHV replicating cells, we could not detect PF-8 protein expressed from KSHV in Western blot analysis even with the same PF-8 antibody used in IFA. Due to this limitation, we were only able to show interaction of endogenous PARP1 or CHFR with MYC- or FLAG-tagged PF-8 in Western blot. Our gene knockdown experiments showed that an E3 ubiquitin ligase CHFR is essential for PF-8‚Äìmediated PARP1 degradation, which promotes efficient lytic replication (Fig 5). IP-assays with CHFR I306A in shCHFR cells and reporter assays suggest that PF-8 recruits CHFR to enhance the interaction with PARP1, which results in promotion of PARP1 degradation and RTA transactivation. Although UHRF1 is dispensable for the PF-8‚Äìinduced PARP1 degradation, the interaction between PF-8 and UHRF1 may also modulate the PARP1 activity through an unknown mechanism and may play additional roles in viral replication. CHFR is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that acts as a mitotic-checkpoint factor and a tumor suppressor [27,58‚Äì61]. Nevertheless, the function of CHFR in viral replication or pathogenicity has not been documented before our study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHFR is utilized by the virus to promote its replication.
The pull-down assays of PARP1 mutant constructs revealed that the interaction between PARP1 and PF-8 is mediated by the AD (Fig 2). The BRCT motif of PARP1 in the AD is a conserved motif among many other protein motifs participating in the cell cycle and DNA damage response [62]. Additionally, the BRCT motif of PARP1 is known to mediate protein‚Äìprotein interactions among DNA repair proteins, such as XRCC1 and DNA ligase III-Œ± [63‚Äì65]. Our study proved that PF-8, a viral processivity factor, binds to PARP1 through association with the BRCT motif. Our experiments on PF-8 deletion mutants show that aa 1‚Äì27 and 277‚Äì304, which are missing in mutants PF-8 ŒîN and PF-8 ŒîI, respectively, are critical for PARP1 degradation and association between PF-8 and PARP1 (Fig 3). Additionally, the interaction of PF-8 with PARP1, but not with RTA, turned out to be crucial for PF-8‚Äìmediated upregulation of lytic genes. Crystal structure of PF-8 has revealed that these domains contain a Œ≤-sheet (Œ≤A1, aa 7 to 11) and an Œ±-helix (Œ±A1, aa13 to 30) at the N terminus and two Œ≤-sheets (Œ≤H2, aa 278 to 283; Œ≤I2, aa 291 to 297) in an internal region [22]. Thus, the functions of mutant proteins PF-8 ŒîN and PF-8 ŒîI may be defective due to the disruption of overall protein folding. On the contrary, the results of this study indicate that mutant proteins PF-8 ŒîN and PF-8 ŒîI are deficient in PARP1 interaction and degradation but not in terms of protein expression, nuclear localization, and interaction with RTA. These data imply that these mutant proteins may hold proper protein folding sufficient enough to maintain certain biological activities (Fig 3). In contrast, the PF-8 ŒîC mutant protein was found to be as functional as the WT in terms of PARP1 degradation induction and the reduction in the level of PARylated RTA but deficient in the interaction with RTA, thereby helping us to further narrow down the RTA interaction domain of PF-8 from aa 266‚Äì396 to aa 369‚Äì396 [18]. Interestingly, the same domain of PF-8 associated with PARP1 is also required for CHFR interaction. Given that PF-8 dimer presents two identical interaction domains away from the dimeric interface, based on the crystal structure [22], PF-8 dimer may interact with PARP1 and CHFR via the same domain of each monomer regions, facilitating interaction between PARP1 and CHFR. Our proposed working model is depicted in Fig 10.

A schematic diagram depicting PF-8-induced PARP1 degradation via recruitment of CHFR to promote KSHV lytic replication.(A) PARP1 interacts with RTA and inhibits RTA function through PARylation of RTA. Lytic replication is under repression. (B) PF-8 is expressed as an early gene product of KSHV lytic genes. PF-8 interacts with CHFR, an E3 ligase, and recruits it to target PARP1, and resulted in polyubiquitination and degradation of PARP1. PF-8-induced PARP1 degradation derepresses the RTA activity and promotes efficient lytic replication of KSHV.

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009261.g010In conclusion, this study shows that KSHV PF-8 recruits host CHFR (a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase) to target PARP1 for proteasomal degradation, thereby promoting efficient KSHV lytic replication. The domain deletion experiments proved that the same domains of PF-8 which directly associate with PARP1 and CHFR, are crucial for the induction of PARP1 degradation (Figs 3 and 7). Therefore, this study revealed a novel mechanism via which a viral processivity factor facilitates lytic replication as well as the importance of PARP1 and CHFR for the regulation of the gammaherpesvirus replication cycle.

BC-3 cells (KSHV-positive B cells) were cultured in the complete RPMI 1640 medium (Welgene) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlas) and penicillin and streptomycin (10 U/mL; HyClone).


Plasmids and cloning
To generate WT PF-8 and mutant constructs PF-8 ŒîN and PF-8 ŒîC, genomic DNA from BC-3 cells was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with the primers listed in Table 1, and each PCR product was cloned into the pENTR-3C vector. The PF-8 ŒîI DNA construct was cloned by a two-step PCR method. In the first PCR, DNA amplification was performed with the following primer pairs: PF-8 WT-F and PF-8 ŒîI-R as well as PF-8 ŒîI-F and PF-8 WT-R. These two amplicons were subjected to a second PCR, with the PF-8 WT F and R primer pair. The resultant amplicon was a DNA fragment with the deletion of a sequence encoding aa 277‚Äì304 of PF-8 (PF-8 ŒîI mutant). To generate the destination vector harboring FLAG-tagged or MYC-tagged PF-8 or its mutants, the PCR-amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the pENTR3C plasmid.

These clones were then transferred to a FLAG-tagging (pDEST-SG5-FLAG) destination vector via the Gateway technology. For the CHFR knockdown, the shCHFR construct (expressing short hairpin RNA; shRNA) was generated using the following primer pair: shCHFR-F (5‚Ä≤-CCGGAGCATAAGTTTACAGCCTACACTCGAGTGTAGGCTGTAAACTTATGCTTTTTTG-3‚Ä≤) and shCHFR-R (5‚Ä≤-AATTCAAAAAAGCATAAGTTTACAGCCTACACTCGAGTGTAGGCTGTAAACTTATGCT-3‚Ä≤). The construct was then inserted into the pLKO.1 TRC cloning vector, following the TRC cloning protocol [59]. The sequences of the clones were verified by conventional sequencing.

Transfection and transduction
HEK293T cells were transfected using polyethylenimine (1 mg/mL) (PEI; Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, PA, USA). Briefly, DNA was incubated with PEI in the ratio of 1:5 for 20 min at room temperature in the DMEM. The HEK293T cells were treated with this mixture. HeLa cells were transfected by means of the PEI complex at pH 4.0 [69]. To construct HA-Ub-expressing BC-3 cells, the cells were transfected with via electroporation. Electroporation was performed at 1,350 V for 40 ms using a Microporator MP-100 (Digital Bio) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. The transfected cells were incubated for the various time and subjected to further assays. To produce the lentiviruses for transduction, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the lentiviral construct (C274-FLAG-PF-8, 53BP1trunc-Apple or various shRNA-encoding plasmids) and packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G [43,70]. The culture medium containing the lentivirus was centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min three times every 24 h. The supernatant was passed through a 0.45 Œºm capsule filter (Sartorius). The supernatant was then incubated with target cells to express the FLAG-tagged PF-8, 53BP1trunc-Apple or to knock down a target gene. The transduced cells were selected in the medium containing 1 Œºg/mL puromycin. The C274-FLAG-PF-8 transduced cells were sorted based on green-fluorescence signal using sorted by a FACSAria (BD Bioscience). iSLK.219 cells were transduced with the shCHFR or shCtrl lentiviral vector without puromycin selection [10].


Luciferase reporter assays
A Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used to measure the activities of the KSHV PAN promoter and the RTA promoter [20,21]. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with a promoter‚Äìluciferase construct and RTA and/or PF-8 expression constructs. The cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection and analyzed for luciferase activity, following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions (Promega). Each transfection was performed in triplicate, and EGFP served as an internal control.


Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from the cells using the TRI reagent (Molecular Research center, Cincinnati, OH, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. cDNAs were synthesized from the isolated RNA with the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) and random hexamers. The transcripts were quantified via a Rotor-Gene qRT-PCR Detection System (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The qRT-PCR analysis was performed with the following primer pairs: PF-8 (Forward, 5‚Ä≤-CTCCCTCGGCAGACACAGAT-3‚Ä≤; Reverse, 5‚Ä≤-GCGTGGTGCACACCGACGCCC-3‚Ä≤), RTA (Forward, 5‚Ä≤-GTGGCAATGAGGATGACTTGTTC-3‚Ä≤; Reverse, 5‚Ä≤-TAGTGGTGGTCGGAGATTCGTA-3‚Ä≤) and PAN RNA (Forward, 5‚Ä≤- ATAGGCGACAAAGTG AGGTGGCAT-3‚Ä≤; Reverse, 5‚Ä≤- TAACATTGAAAGAGCGCTCCCAGC-3‚Ä≤) [71]. The expression level of a transcript was normalized to that of ACTB (Œ≤-actin) mRNA, which was amplified with the following primer pair: Forward, 5‚Ä≤-GTATCCTGACCCTGAAGTACC-3‚Ä≤; Reverse, 5‚Ä≤-TGAAGGTCTCAAACATGATCT-3‚Ä≤. The qRT-PCR was carried out using SYBR green. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95¬∞C for 15 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95¬∞C for 10 s, 55¬∞C for 15 s, and 72¬∞C for 20 s. The qRT-PCR analysis was followed by a melting curve analysis, following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.


Quantitative real-time PCR
Total DNA was isolated from KSHV-replicating cell culture media using QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen). ORF59 locus specific primers (Forward, 5‚Ä≤-CTCCCTCGGCAGACACAGAT-3‚Ä≤; Reverse, 5‚Ä≤-GCGTGGTGCACACCGACGCCC-3‚Ä≤) were used to determine the copy numbers of viral genomic DNAs. The real-time PCR was carried out using SYBR green. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95¬∞C for 15 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95¬∞C for 10 s, 55¬∞C for 15 s, and 72¬∞C for 20 s. The viral DNA copy number was calculated via a Rotor-Gene qRT-PCR Detection System (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).


Western blotting analysis
Whole-cell lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (0.45 Œºm pore size). The membrane was probed with primary antibodies: anti-FLAG-M2 (1:2,000; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-MYC (1:500; laboratory-made or 1:2,000; Roche), anti-RTA (1:500; laboratory-made), anti-K8 (1:500; laboratory-made), anti-GFP (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-PARP1 (1:1,000; BD Biosciences), anti-PAR (1:500; Trevigen), anti-CHFR (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-UHRF1 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-H2AX (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-Œ≥H2AX (1:500; Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) or anti-Œ±-tubulin (1:2,000; Sigma). The membrane was then incubated with the horseradish peroxidase‚Äìconjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody (1:5000; a secondary antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The protein bands were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and western blotting detection reagents (ELPIS, Taejeon, Republic of Korea). The protein bands were documented on an LAS-4000 chemiluminescent image analyzer (Fujifilm). The band intensities were calculated in the ImageJ software [72].


The co-IP assays
The transfected or transduced cells were incubated at 4¬∞C for 1 h with IP lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES-KCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% of Nonidet P-40, and 1% of Triton X-100) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100; Sigma). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 g and 4¬∞C for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with the various antibodies at 4¬∞C for 1 h in a shaker. Next, the samples were mixed with protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and kept at 4¬∞C for 16 h. After that, the beads were washed with IP buffer, and the proteins were analyzed by western blotting.


The immunofluorescence assay and confocal microscopy
HeLa cells were seeded onto a cover glass in a 24-well plate for 24 h before transfection. The DNA constructs were transfected into the cells by the PEI transfection method for 48 h. The cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.15% picric acid in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 10% normal goat serum prepared in PBS containing 0.3% of Triton X-100 and 0.1% of bovine serum albumin. The TPA or DMSO treated BC-3 cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and fixed for 10 min in cold acetone. The fixed cells were washed again with PBS and air-dried. Then the cells were blocked with 10% normal goat serum prepared in PBS containing 0.3% of Triton X-100 and 0.1% of bovine serum albumin. Next, the cells were incubated with the anti-MYC (1:200), anti-PF-8 (1:100; a kind gift from Dr. Bala Chandran at University of South Florida (Tampa, Florida, USA)), anti-CHFR (1:100), and anti-PARP1 (1:800; Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies for 16 h at 4¬∞C, followed by probing with secondary antibodies (anti-mouse-Cy3 and anti-rabbit-Rho; 1:2,000; Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA, USA) for 45 min at room temperature. After that, the cells were incubated with 4‚Ä≤,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1:1000) for nuclear staining. Fluorescence images were captured at a magnification of 1000√ó under a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 5 Exciter, Zeiss).

Abstract:
  Simple SummaryThere are at least four forms of Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma (KS) with the ‚ÄòHIV‚Äô-related form being the most aggressive and can involve mucosae or visceral organs. Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is the underlying cause of this disease. It can infect endothelial and/or mesenchymal cells and establish a latent phase in host cells in which latency proteins and various non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a complex role in proliferation and angiogenesis. It also undergoes periods of sporadic lytic reactivation that are key for KS progression. Complex interactions with the microenvironment with production of inflammatory cytokines and paracrine signaling is a standout feature of KS development and maintenance.

AbstractKaposi‚Äôs sarcoma (KS) is a heterogeneous angioproliferative tumor that generally arises in the skin. At least four forms of this disease have been described, with the ‚ÄòHIV‚Äô-related form being the most aggressive and can involve mucosae or visceral organs. Three quarters of KS cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as geographic variation is explained by the disparate prevalence of KS-associated herpes virus (KSHV), which is the underlying cause of this disease. It can infect endothelial and/or mesenchymal cells that consequently transdifferentiate to an intermediate state. KSHV establishes a latent phase in host cells in which latency proteins and various non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a complex role in proliferation and angiogenesis. It also undergoes periods of sporadic lytic reactivation triggered by various biological signals in which lytic stage proteins modulate host cell signaling pathways and are key in KS progression. Complex interactions with the microenvironment with production of inflammatory cytokines with paracrine signaling is a standout feature of KS development and maintenance. KSHV impairs the immune response by various mechanisms such as the degradation of a variety of proteins involved in immune response or binding to cellular chemokines. Treatment options include classical chemotherapy, but other novel therapies are being investigated.

  1. Kaposi‚Äôs Sarcoma: Definition & EpidemiologyIn 1872, Moritz Kaposi, a Hungarian physician, first noted multifocal pigmented skin lesions in elderly European and Mediterranean men. He was describing what is now known as the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù form of Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma (KS) [1], which is typically an indolent disease, and primarily affects skin on the legs. In the middle of the 20th century, cases of ‚Äúendemic‚Äù lymphadenopathic forms of KS were being described in children and young/adults of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [2]. Later in the 1960s, an ‚Äúiatrogenic‚Äù form of KS was observed in patients receiving immunosuppressive medication and organ transplant recipients [3]. Incidence of ‚Äúiatrogenic‚Äù KS is reported to be 200-fold higher in solid-organ transplant recipients than in the general population [4]. More recently in the beginning of the 1980s, the ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related KS was described by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) at the onset of the AIDS epidemic affecting homosexual men [5,6]. A fifth form that occurs at any skin site, usually indolent with few lesions, is hypothesized to exist in young or middle-aged homosexual men without HIV infection [7]. All epidemiological forms of this angioproliferative tumor generally arise in the skin of the extremities as nodular lesions, multiple plaques, or patches, and less frequently on mucosa and visceral sites mostly in immunosuppressed patients.The ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù HIV-related form is particularly aggressive and can involve mucosae or visceral organs [8,9]. Compared with the general population, KS rates are elevated 500-fold among people living with HIV (PLWH) [10], but epidemiologists were convinced for many years that KS was caused by a second oncogenic virus [11]. In 1994, a breakthrough discovery of the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), also known as KSHV (Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma-associated herpes virus), was identified in KS lesions obtained from AIDS patients [12].The incidence of KS varies considerably around the world [13,14]. According to the latest GLOBOCAN estimates, nearly three-quarters of global KS cases in 2020 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with around 34,270 cases diagnosed worldwide [13,14]. Before the AIDS epidemic, it was a rare disease (0.01 to 1 per 100,000/year in Europe) affecting men more frequently than women. The incidence is reported to be >200-fold higher in immunocompromised populations (AIDS, organ transplantation). Since the emergence of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, estimating the incidence of ‚Äúnon-HIV related‚Äù KS has become more difficult. After a dramatic increase in the early phase of the epidemic [15], the ‚ÄúHIV-related‚Äù KS incidence decreased significantly with the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in PLWH, especially in high-income settings [16]. In a recent epidemiological study, it was estimated that around 70% of the current global KS burden could be prevented by eradication of HIV infection [17]. In 2022, on the IARC website [13], the incidence is reported to be 3.7/106/year. In a recent epidemiological nationwide study conducted in France, the incidence of KS was 2.5/106/year, with 18% occurring in an HIV context, and 28% in patients with immunodepression [18]. In another study conducted in three EU regions, the incidence was found to be 3.7/106/year, higher in the Italian region (Veneto) as compared to two other French regions (Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes, Aquitaine) [19].  2. KSHV IncidenceThis geographic variation of KS is driven by the disparate prevalence of KSHV, which is the underlying cause of all forms of KS, and HIV infection that worsens the carcinogenic outcome of KSHV infection [14]. The prevalence of KSHV is lowest in the United States, Asia, and Northern Europe, where it affects less than 10% of the population, higher in some areas in the Mediterranean (20‚Äì30%), and highest in regions of equatorial SSA where it can reach more than 90% [14]. Saliva and close sexual contact are the main transmission routes, and to a lesser extent, through blood [20,21]. Regardless of the region or population group, a meta-analysis showed that HIV infection is associated with a high prevalence of KSHV, with a strong association for men that have sex with men (MSM) and weaker for heterosexual adults and intravenous drug users [22]. Several mechanisms might explain this association, including reactivation of pre-existing KSHV in PLWH, increased susceptibility to KSHV infections in PLWH, and shared transmission routes [23].  3. Kaposi‚Äôs Sarcoma-Associated Herpes Virus (KSHV)KSHV, also known HHV8, is a double-stranded linear DNA gamma-herpesvirus and is the causal agent of all forms of Kaposi sarcomas. It is also the underlying cause of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman Disease (MCD) [14]. A link with osteosarcoma has also been recently suggested in an epidemiological study of the Uyghur population [24]. KSHV contains a double-stranded DNA with 90 open reading frames, an icosahedral capsid, a tegument, and an envelope [25]. It can infect a variety of cell types using viral envelope glycoproteins, including monocytes, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, B cells, and endothelial cells [26]. Receptors of KSHV include heparan sulfate binding proteins; Œ±3Œ≤1, Œ±VŒ≤3, Œ±ŒΩŒ¥ Œ±VŒ≤5 integrins; EphA2 receptors; and DC-SIGN [27].Similar to other herpesviruses, KSHV establishes latency in host cells (endothelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and B cells in this case), responsible for lifelong infection. During latency, only a few genes from the latency locus are expressed, such as open reading frame (ORF)71 (v-FLIP), ORF72 (v-Cyclin), ORF73 (latency-associated nuclear antigen, or LANA), and the K12 region (which gives rise to at least 12 viral miRNAs) [28]. LANA binds to histones and enables the tethering of the latent KSHV circular episome to the host chromosome so that it can be replicated during cell division [29]. Latent gene-encoded proteins ensure cell survival by several different mechanisms like the inhibition of apoptosis or by stimulation of the nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) pathway [30,31]. Latency is the default pathway of the virus, but KSHV undergoes sporadic periods of lytic reactivation [26,31]. During the lytic replication phase, all genes are expressed in a temporal order (immediate-early genes (IE), delayed-early genes (DE), and late genes (LG) so that the viral genome is replicated. The infectious virions are then released via budding and death of the host cell, enabling the infection of other cells. Paradoxically, lytic reactivation is an important feature of KS progression and oncogenesis, as discussed hereunder. Protein products of the IE phase control transcription and one of these proteins; replication and transcription activator (RTA) is the master switch transcription factor ensuring the activation of viral and cellular promoters [25,31]. The DE phase proteins are responsible for viral DNA replication, and the late phase ensures the expression of viral structural proteins and the production of the infectious virus [25,31].  4. Histology and Cellular Origin of KSKSHV affects endothelial cells and/or mesenchymal cells that consequently adopt an endothelial differentiation. Early lesions (plaque or patch) often appear as a granulation type reaction with immune cell infiltration, intense angiogenesis, and proliferating ‚Äúspindle‚Äù-shaped cells of endothelial and macrophagic cell origin, which are the tumor cells of KS. A typical KS is characterized by proliferation of spindle-shaped endothelial cells in the skin and sometimes in mucosal and visceral sites. Kaposi cells form slit-like vascular spaces, with often extravasated inflammatory cells and red blood cells. In late, nodular, lesions of KS, tumor cells eventually become the predominant cell type and lesions acquire a fibrosarcoma-like aspect, though neoangiogenesis is present [9]. KS cells express both pan-endothelial and lymphatic endothelial markers (e.g., ERG) and may also appear as poorly differentiated spindle cells expressing markers of a variety of cell types. KSHV infection causes reprogramming of the cellular gene expression, as well as a morphological change of the cells to KS ‚Äúspindle cells‚Äù [31,32]. KS cells express the LANA protein of KSHV, which is detectable on IHC and is used to confirm the presence of KSHV in a suspected KS lesion. As mentioned above, LANA is a viral protein essential for viral episomal persistence. The infected endothelial cell then undergoes an endothelial to mesenchymal transition, a phenomenon possibly related to the capacity of the LANA to induce mesenchymal cell programs [30]. KSHV has also been reported to infect mesenchymal stem cells [33,34]. A process of transdifferentiation to an intermediate state of both endothelial and mesenchymal cells either by mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition or by endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition occurs in response to viral infection [33,34]. Mesenchymal stem cells infected with KSHV also express a set of makers of both mesenchymal and endothelial cells and produce PDGF and other angiogenic factors such as VEGF & FGF [33,34].Spontaneous reactivation of KSHV in lymphatic endothelial cells is important to maintain and expand the population of infected cells in the tumor and to promote tumor cell expansion. The mechanisms of activation of the lytic stage in these cells may involve specific transcription factors. Prox1 is a lymphatic endothelial cell-specific transcription factor that induces the expression of the RTA gene to promote lytic cycles, while SOX18, another transcription factor necessary for lymphatic endothelial cell development, promotes an increase in the number of latent genomes. Both are induced by KSHV infection and play an important role in KS oncogenesis, Prox1 being necessary to maintain the number of infected cells in the tumor [35,36].  5. Molecular Mechanisms of TransformationOncogenic DNA viruses produce oncogenic proteins responsible for cellular proliferation and the protection of the host cell against apoptosis. They evade the host immune surveillance system by multiple mechanisms such as the reduction of viral gene expression to limit the amount of viral antigen presentation, the synthesis of critical proteins affecting the process of antigen presentation, and the expression of various viral ‚Äúimmunoevasins‚Äù that manipulate host cells to reduce immunogenicity [37,38] (Table 1).Following KSHV infection of endothelial cells (or mesenchymal stem cells), it establishes a latent phase, expressing a limited set of genes, including LANA (ORF73), vFLIP (ORF71), vCyclin (ORF72), Kaposins (ORFK12), and a set of miRNAs. Some of these proteins are analogs of cellular genes (FLIP, Cyclin D) and have oncogenic properties in vitro in cell cultures [37,38].These latent proteins, along with the miRNAs, play a complex role in cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. They promote the tumorigenesis of KS. ORF72 (vCyclin) expression overcomes senescence in infected endothelial cells and activates a telomere maintenance mechanism essential for the oncogenic process in KSHV-infected cells [39,40]. LANA induces the cleavage of the Aurora B kinase and increases expression of the pro-survival factor MCL-1 [41,42]. KSHV encodes various non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are also found in humans, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), small and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) [43,44]. These KSHV ncRNAs play an important role in transformation [43]. Some miRNAs block apoptosis by targeting the pro-apoptotic CASP3 gene [45] or the mTOR inhibitory factor CASTOR1 [46]. KSHV miRNAs also target immune-regulatory gene transcripts in a collaborative way in order to evade immune surveillance [43]. miR-K12-9 targets MYD88 and IRAK1 transcripts thus impairing the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling cascade. miR-K12-5 downregulates MyD88, impairing downstream pro-inflammatory signals [47]. CircRNAs are a novel class of ncRNAs playing a role in tumorigenesis of KS by promoting cell proliferation [48].  6. Lytic Cycle and KS ProgressionLytic cycles of KSHV are observed in lymphatic and endothelial cells and in KS cells. They play a key role in the progression of KS in the clinic (Table 1). The induction of lytic genes requires the sequential expression of IE genes, DE genes, and LG. IE gene expression do not require protein synthesis, indicating that cellular proteins, epigenetic regulators, and host transcription factors are involved in KSHV reactivation. The activation of the lytic stages is triggered by a variety of biological signals. It involves the modulation of cellular epigenetic machinery, the activation of signaling pathways (MAPK), the modulation of viral and host ncRNAs, and a defective function of the immune system [31]. All these events converge to counteract LANA-mediated repression of lytic gene transcriptionand the induction of RTA, which transactivates KSHV lytic genes [31].Several lytic stage proteins modulate host cell signaling pathways to allow cell survival and proliferation and to augment viral replication [31]. In the clinic, the progression of KS requires the development of lytic cycles in vivo to disseminate the virus within the host and maintain the pool of latently infected cells [14]. Though paradoxical, this was suspected early with the observation that anti-CMV agents were able to induce KS responses in AIDS patients. Antibodies against lytic proteins can be detected in patients that will develop KS prior to the onset of disease, suggesting that high levels of reactivation from latency occur before disease development [49]. In vitro, KSHV is rapidly lost in cell cultures. Thus, the persistence of a pool of latently infected cells in vivo requires the activation lytic cycles. This consequently results in the production of oncogenic proteins, as well as secreted proangiogenic and pro-inflammatory cytokines essential for the oncogenesis of KS [50,51,52,53,54,55]. The activation of lytic cycles is also associated with the production of viral proteins that play a key role in KS tumor progression and are detectable in KS lesions. These include viral oncogenes and intracellular or membrane proteins, such as vGPCR, which is an analog of IL-8R (not requiring the presence of the ligand to deliver the signal).vGPCR induces the production of cytokines such as PDGF and VEGF, which is considered important for the development of the lesions. Transgenic mice expressing vGPCR develop KS-like lesions [50]. Other proteins are produced during the lytic cycle such as vIL-6, detectable in the peripheral blood of KS patients [14], and viral chemokines, which play an important role in KS growth and progression by modulating immune response. The K1 and K15 membrane proteins also exert oncogenic properties. K1 is expressed at low levels in latency and higher during the lytic cycle; K1 has an ITAM signal in its intracellular domain, enabling signal transduction. K1 activates the PI3K/mTOR pathway, blocks Fas-mediated killing, induces VEGF, and activates the MAPK pathway. The viral protein kinase (vPK) is a ribosome S6 kinase analog, a cellular protein acting downstream of mTOR [51]. K15 is also a transmembrane protein that expressed a low level in latency at higher levels in the lytic cycle, which activates the MAPK pathway as well as NFkB. Both transmembrane proteins are detectable in KS lesions [52].The oncogenic proteins of KSHV thus activate a series of cellular pathways, the MAPK, NFkB, and PI3K pathways, as well as the production of proinflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors, which play a key role in the oncogenesis of KS. One of the intriguing features of KSHV-induced oncogenesis is the contribution of soluble factors.  7. Cytokines and Paracrine Growth Factor Production in KSThe infection of endothelial cells with KSHV results in cell transformation, accompanied by complex interactions with the microenvironment (Table 1). Infected cells produce cytokines that induce paracrine signaling, including vascular endothelial growth (VEGF), PDGF, FGF, and interleukin 6 (IL-6). These cytokines are implicated in the development and maintenance of KS [43]. Murine mesenchymal stem cells are not transformed by KSHV infection, but require coculture in KS-derived media to acquire a transformed phenotype [55].The previously mentioned lytic gene ORF74, encoding for the constitutively active vGPCR, activates MAP kinase and NFkB pathways [55], inducing the production of VEGF, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, and promoting tumorigenesis through autocrine and paracrine pathways [56,57,58,59,60]. Other lytic genes including vPK, viral IL-6 homolog (vIL-6/K2), viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF1/K9), and the membrane proteins K1 and K15 have oncogenic functions [56,59,60]. KSHV vIL-6 can activate the JAK‚ÄìSTAT, PI3K-AKT, and MAPK‚ÄìERK pathways upon binding directly to gp130 dimers inducing the production of cellular IL-6, along with other viral proteins (Kaposins) [56,57,58]. It was shown more recently that vIL-6 decreases the expression of caveolin 1 and increases the expression of integrin Œ≤3 through its activation of STAT3, which contributes to its angiogenic-like behavior [59,60]. ORF36 phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 to increase protein synthesis and growth, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation [59].All these elements are responsible for the production of inflammatory cytokines, with paracrine and endocrine paraneoplastic activities.  8. Immune EvasionThe immune system plays an important role in the control of KS (Table 1). Restoration of immune system function with cART in AIDS patients with progressive KS is often sufficient to induce tumor response in HIV-related KS [14]. There are numerous mechanisms by which KSHV impairs the immune response.KSHV produces proteins and miRNAs that impair cytotoxic T or NK cell-mediated killing [60]. KSHV K3 and K5, both ubiquitin ligases, promote the degradation of a variety of proteins involved in immune response, including MHC-I, CD1d, CD31, IFN-gR1, CD54, B7-2, CD1d, MICA, and MICB, interfering with CD8+ T cell and NK cell function [62,63,64,65]. KSHV miR-K12-7 downregulates MICB expression [63]. vOX2 protein, a cellular ortholog of CD200 expressed in the lytic phase, was found in-vitro to suppress antigen(Ag)-specific T cell response. KSHV protein RTA also impairs CD4+ T cell function, promoting the degradation of MHC-II and inducing MARCH-8, a MHC-II antagonist [66].The inhibition of immune response induced by KSHV occurs at multiple steps of the development of the immune response, from the initial activation of innate immunity. KSHV viral interferon regulatory factors (vIRFs) impair TLR signaling at multiple levels: vIRF reduce TLR3-mediated interferon induction [67]. The RTA protein also regulates TLR signaling by promoting proteasomal degradation of the downstream TLR3 adaptor protein TRIF, as well as downregulation of TLR2 [68,69]. RTA also blocks TLR4 signaling by promoting degradation of MyD88 mRNA [70]. KSHV infection in endothelial cells also rapidly suppresses TLR4 signaling via vGPCR and vIRF1-mediated mechanisms [71].KSHV induces the production of viral cytokines and chemokines while inducing the production of cellular inflammatory cytokines. This is observed in vitro when monocytes are infected by KSHV, and in vivo in patients with KS. These increased serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF, and detectable vIL-6, are indeed observed in patients with progressive KS [62]. These cytokines are known to exert proliferative activities directly on tumor cells, but also immunosuppressive functions (IL-6, IL-10) [72,73], as well as paraneoplastic inflammatory activities, referred to as KSHV-associated inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS), with very high circulating levels of IL-6 and IL-10 [74,75,76]. KSHV also modulates IL-4/13-STAT6 signaling by inducing constitutive phosphorylation of STAT6 through a LANA-mediated cleavage and subsequent nuclear translocation of STAT6 contributing to evasion from immune surveillance [77,78].KSHV also contains three viral homologs of cellular chemokines, vCCL1 to vCCL3 (also known as vMIP-I to vMIP-III). vCCL2 binds to a wide variety of chemokine receptors on many different cell types and can have agonistic or inhibitory effects. vCCL1 binds to CCR8, which is prominently expressed on Treg cells, suggesting that the virus may recruit this T cell subtype [79]. vCCL2 has been shown to bind CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) and CCR5, blocking their natural ligands and inhibiting the migration of naive and activated NK cells [79]. vCCL2 also antagonizes CCR1 and CCR5 activation, which are primarily found on Th1 cells, while stimulating CCR3 and CCR8, which has been shown to attract Th2 cells to KS lesions [79]. By promoting Th2 cell attraction, this protein may allow immune escape of infected cells. vCCL3 is an agonist of CCR4, another chemokine receptor found preferentially on Th2 and Treg cells. vCCL3 also preferentially induces chemotaxis in Th2 cells when compared to Th1 cells, suggesting that viral chemokines may play a role in creating the characteristically Th2-skewed KS microenvironment [79].  9. Genetic Predispositions to Develop KS after KSHV InfectionAs mentioned previously, there is a high individual variability in disease development and presentation within all forms of KS. Genetic differences between populations could explain this heterogeneity, suggested by the observation of familial clustering of KS cases [80]. Polymorphisms in genes of the HLA subtype, in immune regulation genes such as NFŒ∫B or LY6G6C, and in subtypes of the NK cell receptor KIR, have been linked to KSHV infection or development of KS [81]. It is not yet clear how and if these polymorphisms modify the course of the disease.  10. Therapeutic ImplicationsTo what extent can the partial understanding of the oncogenesis of KS guide us to new treatment decisions?There are multiple active treatments of KS. While classic chemotherapy has been used for decades, many clinical trials evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors or anti-angiogenic agents are underway in both HIV and non-HIV-related KS. The treatment of KS in the clinic is based on consideration of multiple criteria including patient‚Äôs comorbidities and preferences, disease extension, and the immunological and virological status of the patient [82]. Since KHSV cannot be eradicated from the body, KS cannot be cured, but long term remissions are now routinely observed in particular when an underlying immunodepression has been corrected. Modification of immunosuppressive therapies for iatrogenic-KS or optimal control of HIV infection with cART for HIV-associated KS should be the first preferred option whenever possible [83].If insufficient, e.g., in advanced or very symptomatic disease, chemotherapy can be considered. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is a standard first line [84]. Paclitaxel is also commonly prescribed in first-line and can be safely used with cART [85].Other front-line options include docetaxel and nab-paclitaxel as small studies have shown comparable efficacy and acceptable toxicity [86,87]. Oral Etoposide, gemcitabine, bleomycine, and vinca-alcaloids, are all options after failure of first-line chemotherapy [88,89,90,91]. However, these are not specific targeted therapies.With the identification of the role of endogenous cytokines, angiogenic factors, and immune suppressive factors in KS progression, anti-angiogenic agents & immunomodulators are investigated [92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99]. The monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab resulted in a 31% response rate (RR) in monotherapy and up to 56% in combination with PLD [94,95]. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib is a potent antiangiogenic, but activity was found modest in an early phase trial with a 29% RR [96].Pomalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent capable of reversing viral-induced downregulation of immune surface receptors, rendering KS cells more immunogenic. Promising results were observed in prospective trials with RRs up to 40% for HIV-related KS [92,93]. Chronic T-cell stimulation by HIV and oncogenic viruses can lead to an increase in immune checkpoint receptors on T cells, leading to an eventual T-cell exhaustion [97]. Nevertheless, PLWH were excluded from the majority of the clinical trials testing immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the anti-PD-1/PDL-1 antibodies that have now revolutionized cancer care. The main concerns were the reactivation of HIV and toxicity [98]. In a recent phase Ib trial, monotherapy with pembrolizumab in HIV-related KS resulted in a stable disease (mostly tumor regression not meeting the criteria of partial response) in five out six patients [99], but reports emerged on KSHV lymphoproliferation potentially attributed to pembrolizumab.KICS is a severe life-threatening condition related to an overwhelming production of proinflammatory cytokines [76]. Treatment with anti-cytokine antibodies such as anti-IL-6 was reported as active in a small series of single cases of KS patients [76,77,78], consistent with that observed for other sarcomas [100]. Other early-phase trials are currently ongoing, including combination therapies such as cabozantinib and nivolumab [NCT04514484], pomalidomide and nivolumab [NCT04902443], and ipilimumab and nivolumab [NCT02408861]. Finally, the better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of KS oncogenesis, including the identification of key viral protein targets offers new avenues for innovative therapies. Activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) by the glucose analog 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) was shown to elicit an early antiviral response via eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2Œ±) inactivation, which impairs protein synthesis required to drive viral replication and oncogenesis. Thus, induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by 2-DG might be a promising strategy [101]. Potent in-vitro inhibitory activity against KSHV replication by the protease inhibitor (PI) nelfinavir was demonstrated in another robust preclinical study [102].Targeting viral miRNAs has promising potential as viral miRNAs are distinct from cellular miRNAs. In a recent study, targeting three KSHV miRNAs with antisense inhibitors suppressed the growth of KSHV lymphoma cells in mouse xenograft models [103].  11. ConclusionsThe understanding of the mechanisms of cellular transformation due to KSHV in KS has considerably progressed 28 years after the identification of the virus. Multiple steps and viral oncoproteins are involved in the transformation process, which requires a complex interplay between the viral oncoproteins and cellular proteins as well as the modulation of the host‚Äôs immune system response. This opens new avenues for the treatment of this multifaceted disease that affects large human communities across the globe.

Abstract:
  Simple SummaryKaposi‚Äôs sarcoma is a rare tumor caused by human herpesvirus 8 in the context of immunodeficiency, such as that induced by HIV infection or immunosuppressive therapy. In patients living with HIV (PLHIV), thanks to potent antiretroviral treatment that efficiently restores immunity and allows a better control of HIV infection, the occurrence of KS has decreased dramatically over the past 25 years. However, KS is still one the most frequent cancers in PLHIV, in particular in men who have sex with men and in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is still endemic. Even in the context of restored immunity, the risk of KS is still more than 30 times higher in PLHIV than in the general population.  AbstractKaposi‚Äôs sarcoma is an angioproliferative tumor caused by human herpesvirus 8 in the context of immunodeficiency, such as that induced by HIV infection or immunosuppressive therapy. Its incidence has dramatically fallen in patients living with HIV (PLHIV) since the introduction of potent antiretroviral combinations 25 years ago due to the restoration of immunity and better control of HIV replication. However, KS is still one of the most frequently occurring cancers in PLHIV, in particular in men who have sex with men and in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is still endemic. Even in the context of restored immunity, the risk of KS is still more than 30 times higher in PLHIV than in the general population. Recent evidence indicates that early initiation of antiretroviral treatment, which is recommended by current guidelines, may reduce the risk of KS but it needs to be accompanied by early access to care. This review mainly focuses on the recent epidemiological features of KS in the context of HIV infection.

  1. History of KS: A Disease Understood Step by StepKaposi‚Äôs sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative tumor that was first described in its ‚Äúclassic form‚Äù at the end of the XIX century by a Hungarian dermatologist, Moritz Kaposi, as a rare indolent cutaneous tumor affecting elderly individuals, mostly men from Eastern Europe and the area bordering the Mediterranean Sea. In the 1950s, a more aggressive and ‚Äúendemic form‚Äù of KS was described in sub-Saharan Africa that affected young African adults and children [1]. In the 1960s, an iatrogenic form of KS was observed in kidney transplant recipients and patients receiving aggressive immunosuppressive therapies [2]. Then, in the 1980s, with the advent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, a new form of KS, the epidemic form, was described in young homosexual men in New York and California [3,4] infected by a new virus, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). From that period onward, KS, which was previously rare and poorly studied, became an epidemic disease in patients with AIDS.The causative agent of KS, human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also reported as KSHV (Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma herpes virus), was identified in 1994 in KS lesions obtained from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [5]. This breakthrough discovery confirmed the previous suggestions, based on epidemiological data, that an oncogenic virus was the etiological agent of KS [6,7]. HHV8 is a necessary cause but is not sufficient for the development of KS. It usually develops in the context of immune deficiency, such as that induced by HIV infection or immunosuppressive therapy.The four forms of KS, the classic (Mediterranean), endemic (African), epidemic (HIV/AIDS-associated), and iatrogenic (transplant-related), share the same causative virus but have distinct epidemiological and clinical presentations. Some authors also hypothesize on the existence of a fifth form (see paragraph 5 below).Here, we will mostly focus on the epidemiology of KS in patients living with HIV (PLHIV) and on recent insights concerning its evolution. Certain insights on post-transplantation and other KS are also provided.  2. Geographical and Population DisparitiesHHV8 infection is not ubiquitous. Its prevalence is substantially higher in men who have sex with men (MSM) and in certain regions of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa or the countries bordering the Mediterranean; whereas it has been estimated to affect < 5% of the general population of the USA and Europe [8]. Although the transmission routes of HHV8 are not fully understood, close sexual contact and saliva have been shown to explain the observed disparities across population groups [9]. Transmission through blood is also possible but to a lesser extent [10].In sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence of HHV8 also varies depending on the region. It reaches 50% in Uganda [11,12], where the prevalence is already high in early childhood, with little increase thereafter, whereas the prevalence in South Africa and Zimbabwe in early adulthood is lower (<15%) and then increases with age [12]. In a recent study investigating patients with tuberculosis symptoms, the authors reported a seroprevalence of 30.7% in Cape Town South Africa [13].A recent meta-analysis [14] estimated the seroprevalence of HHV8 in MSM to be 33.0% (95% confidence interval (CI), 29.2‚Äì37.1) and the factors associated with such high prevalence in this population to be high-risk behavior.Another meta-analysis [15] examined the association between HIV infection and the risk of HHV8 infection across the five continents and showed that HIV infection is associated with a high prevalence of HHV8, regardless of the region or population group. The association was strongest for MSM and children and weaker for heterosexual adults and intravenous drug users. The authors suggested several mechanisms to explain the positive association between HIV and HHV8: reactivation of pre-existing HHV8 in PLHIV [16], increased susceptibility to HHV8 infections in PLHIV [17], and shared transmission routes.As a consequence of the heterogeneous distribution of HHV8, there are geographical disparities in the burden of KS. There were roughly 42,000 new KS cases and 20,000 deaths estimated in 2018 worldwide [18]. KS occurs at a globally higher frequency in men than in women [19] and in the HIV-infected population [20,21,22,23]. Among PLHIV, the incidence rate of KS is much higher for MSM than for other men or women (Figure 1). Of note, the sex difference in sub-Saharan Africa is less pronounced than in European or North-American countries [20].The Globocan 2020 data [19], which compiled the worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality, highlight these disparities across countries. Although KS was extremely rare in most regions of the world (global incidence rates per 100,000 PY being 0.5 in men and 0.3 in women), KS was one of the most frequently occurring cancers in sub-Saharan Africa with highest rates in Southern and Eastern Africa and occurred mostly in PLHIV. In 2012, in Eastern Africa, KS was the leading cause of cancer in men and the third in women (incidence rates of 15.1 per 100,000 PY in men and 7.6 in women) [24].In sub-Saharan Africa, KS is still one of the most common cancers [25,26] and the KS burden has risen since the beginning of the HIV epidemic [24]. For example, the incidence of KS in Zimbabwe increased in both sexes: 7.6 fold in men and 23.9 fold in women between 1963‚Äì1972 and 2011‚Äì2015 [25] (see Figure 2).Overall, these geographical differences are likely related to the combined effect of a higher prevalence of HHV8, a higher prevalence of HIV infection, and lower access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) in these regions. However, the incidence of KS has decreased in all regions of the world since the initiation of cART, as shown by a multiregional comparative study of PLHIV initiating combined ART (cART) [20]. This suggests that a similar decreasing trend in the incidence and burden of KS can also be expected in these regions with the increasing expansion of available ART.  3. KS in PLHIVSince the very beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the first description of KS in a cluster of young MSM [3], KS has been associated with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. KS was considered to be an AIDS-defining disease by the Centers for Disease Control in 1982 and later [27]. Along with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and invasive cervical cancer, KS is one of the three AIDS-defining cancers of the revised AIDS classification of 1993 [28].Prior to the introduction of potent antiretroviral treatment in 1996, which dramatically changed the course of HIV infection in PLHIV by increasing their life expectancy and reducing the incidence of opportunistic diseases, KS was among the most common AIDS-defining diseases in PLHIV. By 1989, 15% of the patients with AIDS in the US reported to the CDC had KS [7]. In France, KS was the first AIDS-defining illness for 13.9% of the patients with AIDS between 1993 and 1995 [29] and it was 17.2% in Australia [30] by 1991.  3.1. Incidence and Risk vs. That in the General PopulationWith the advent of combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) in 1996, and the resulting virological and immunological control of HIV infection, the incidence rate of KS has dramatically declined over time [20,22,31,32,33,34,35]. The relative reduction of the incidence of KS between the pre- and post-cART era has been more than 60% [22,36,37], from more than 3000 to less than 100/100,000 person years [35,38,39]. The decline was sharper during the first periods of cART availability and for MSM [31,33]. Between 1996 and 2003, the relative reduction in the ANRS CO4 FHDH cohort [31] was approximately 70% among MSM and 60% for others. The risk fell more sharply for KS with visceral involvement than for KS without visceral involvement (>50% and 30%, respectively) [31].The most recent data from the USA indicate that the risk of KS is still decreasing [35,38]. In a comprehensive analysis of KS trends among PLHIV in America between 2008 and 2016, a significant continuous decline was reported nationally (‚àí3.2% per year) but also showed stagnation of this decline in certain states and in younger and black PLHIV, probably explained by unequal access to HIV medical care, calling for a continuous effort towards the early diagnosis and treatment of HIV [38].  3.2. Immuno-Deficiency, HIV Viral Load, and CD4/CD8 RatioKS is highly associated with immunodeficiency in PLHIV [21,39,40,41,42]. It is also independently associated with HIV viral load (VL) [21,39,40,41,42]. In the study of Guiguet et al. of the large ANRS CO4 FHDH cohort [21], which investigated the incidence of cancer among more than 50,000 PLHIV followed in France between 1998 and 2006, the risk of KS (n = 565) steadily increased as the recent CD4 cell count decreased and recent viral replication rose (see Figure 1). Such an association with recent CD4 and VL values indicates that immunosuppression and HIV infection may be involved with late stage of KS development. The risk factors of KS have changed over time for PLHIV initiating cART, with HIV viral load becoming increasingly important [20]. Recently, the large North-American cohort collaboration [42] showed an independent association between cumulative VL and KS risk, suggesting that HIV infection may also promote early phases of KS development.Although the risk of KS has declined over time in all transmission groups, the risk of KS is still 300‚Äì500-fold higher in PLHIV than in the general population [22,33,37,43]. Even in PLHIV with restored immunity (i.e., CD4 levels > 500/mm3), large cohorts have shown that the risk of KS is still high. Relative to the general population, the risk is 60-fold higher for patients with a recent CD4 level > 500/mm3 [41] and 35-fold higher for patients with both a CD4 level above 500/mm3 for two years and an HIV viral load < 500 cp/mL [22]. The risk is still over 50-fold higher for PLHIV with long-term viral suppression (i.e., >2 years) than for the uninfected population [44]. Moreover, some studies have reported KS occurring in aviremic patients [45,46,47].Recently, Caby et al. [48] showed low CD4/CD8 ratios to be associated with an increased risk of KS in PLHIV on cART who achieved virological control in the large European collaboration cohort, especially when CD4 was ‚â•500/mm3. Indeed, the association was stronger in this population with restored immunity than in the whole population of virally suppressed PLHIV. The hazard ratio of KS ranged from 1.4 to 3.3 in PLHIV with restored immunity with a CD4/CD8 ratio between 0.8 and 0.3 relative to those with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 1, whereas the risk ranged from 1.2 to 2.6 in the whole population of virally suppressed PLHIV. This is an interesting finding, as the population of PLHIV with high CD4 levels is growing as a result of effective cART and early cART initiation.  3.3. Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)In the context of IRIS, a paradoxical worsening or the first appearance of opportunistic infections and other conditions has been described [49]. Several studies have shown that the incidence of KS is very high in the first 6 months among patients initiating cART and then decreases [23,50,51,52]. In the large European collaboration cohort [50], the incidence rate of KS was highest 6 months after starting cART, at 953 per 100,000 person-years (95%CI, 866‚Äì1048), and declined to 82 (68‚Äì100) after 5‚Äì8 years. Similar results of a high incidence immediately after cART initiation that then steeply declines have been observed, regardless of the region of the world [20].  3.4. Impact of Early cART Initiation on the Risk of KSFollowing the results of the INSIGHT START clinical trial [53], immediate initiation of ART was recommended for all PLHIV, regardless of the CD4 count. The question arises as to whether earlier cART initiation reduces the risk of KS by preventing immune decline through reducing exposure to long periods of immunosuppression and inflammation/activation. In the START trial, which randomized PLHIV with CD4 > 500/mm3 to immediate cART initiation or cART deferral until CD4 dropped < 350/mm3, immediate cART initiation reduced the risk of all cancer by 64%. The risk of KS was also significantly reduced by 91% (95%CI; 0.01‚Äì0.99) but these estimates were based on a very low number of events (1 and 11 in the immediate and deferral group, respectively) and a relatively short follow-up of a median of 2.8 years (IQR 2.1‚Äì3.9). Recently, two large observational studies using causal inference methods have attempted to estimate the effect of early vs. deferred treatment on cancer risk on a larger population with a longer follow-up [54,55]. In the NA-ACCORD study [55], a protective effect of earlier ART for any virus-related cancer, mainly driven by the effect on KS, was observed (HR 0.25; 95%CI, 0.10‚Äì0.61). The DAD study [54] also estimated a protective effect of immediate cART initiation against AIDS-defining cancer, among which KS accounts for 2/3rd of cases, but to a lesser extent.Overall, these results indicate that currently recommended earlier ART initiation may reduce the risk of developing KS. However, improvements in HIV diagnosis and in reducing the time to receive HIV care are needed to better measure the effect of earlier ART on KS risk.  3.5. Age and KS: Little Evidence for Premature Aging in PLHIVIn PLHIV, KS risk is slightly associated with higher age (see Figure 1) in Europe and North America and with a lower age in South Africa and Latin America [20].In resource-rich settings, KS in PLHIV is generally diagnosed at an age of approximately 40 years for PLHIV and 60 years for the general population. The fact that KS apparently occurs at lower age in PLHIV than in the general population is largely due to the differences in the age structure of the two populations and not the premature aging induced by prolonged inflammation/activation that puts PLHIV at higher risk of age-related comorbidities [56]. Indeed, the proportion of PLHIV over 50 years of age is smaller among PLHIV than in the general population. Hleyhel et al. [22] used a methodology to correct for the difference in the age and sex structure of the HIV population relative to that of the general population [57]. They showed that although the mean age at KS diagnosis observed in the HIV population was 40.3 years and 57.5 years in the general population (observed difference of ‚àí17.2 years), the true difference was only ‚àí2.2 years after correction. Such a modest difference does not favor a role for premature aging in KS but rather earlier diagnosis of KS or earlier acquisition of HHV8 in PLHIV, resulting in the promotion of KS development in HIV-HHV8 co-infected patients.  3.6. Treatment of KS in PLHIVIn PLHIV, the advent of combined ART has not only dramatically reduced the risk of KS but also changed the management of KS. Indeed, cART is essential in managing KS when immunosuppression is reversible and is the first KS treatment option in PLHIV [58,59,60,61]. Most often, immune restoration leads by itself to KS lesions regression in several months in localized non-aggressive forms. In more aggressive form, systemic treatments are needed which may rely on chemotherapeutic agents such as liposomal doxorubicin or taxanes or immune-modulating therapy (interferon alpha or PEG-interferon), or antiangiogenic agents.  4. KS in Immune-Suppressed Transplanted PatientsImmunosuppressed organ-transplanted recipients have an increased risk of developing cancer associated with viruses, such as Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus, HHV8, hepatitis B and C, and human papillomavirus [62,63,64,65,66,67]. The risk of KS is much higher in PLHIV than in transplanted recipients (relative risk 3624 vs. 208 relative to that of the general population, respectively) [64]. Post-transplant KS generally develops 2‚Äì3 years after transplantation [68,69,70] and is largely due to HHV8 reactivation in transplant receivers, although HHV8 can also be transmitted by donor organs [71,72].Recently, a large American linkage study between a transplant registry and cancer registry [69] showed that the factors associated with post-transplant KS were also those associated with a higher prevalence of HHV8: male sex, nonwhite race, non-US citizenship, higher age at transplant, and lung transplant (vs kidney). In this study, from a country where the prevalence of HHV8 is low (<5%), the incidence rate after transplantation was 12.4/100,000 and significantly declined over time from 1987 to 2014. In another recent study reporting post-transplantation KS between 1997 and 2016 in Italy, where the prevalence of HHV8 is between 10 and 30%, the incidence rate was 10 times higher (123.7/100,000) and decreased over time [70]. Interestingly, the incidence rates were much lower for those receiving mTOR inhibitors than those who were not.Post transplantation KS is generally managed by reducing the immunosuppressive treatment to the lowest levels compatible with allograft function or by changing the immunosuppressive agent, such as changing from calcineurin inhibitors to mTOR inhibitors [68,73].There are currently no specific recommendations for HHV8 screening (as there is no specific treatment for HHV8 infection) nor for cancer or a fortiori KS screening in transplanted patients. Furthermore, there is a consensus that neither donor nor recipient anti-HHV8 antibodies preclude transplantation.  5. The Other Forms of KS: The Classic KS and Endemic KSApart from immunodeficiency induced by HIV/AIDS or by iatrogenic treatment, KS have drawn less attention in recent years. Classic KS occur mostly in elderly men living or emigrating from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea (Italy). Before the AIDS epidemic, classic KS incidence rate was estimated as 1.58/100,000 person-years in Sardinia [74] while it was only 0.014/100,000 person-years in the UK [75]. Endemic KS occurs in children or young adults living in regions where the HHV8 is endemic (sub-Saharan Africa). Some authors also described KS arising in MSM in absence of HIV infection as a fifth form of KS [58,73,76]. The underlying mechanisms for the development of these KS in addition to HHV8 infection are not well understood. They likely also involve a part of immune deficiency due to ageing for classic KS and to multiple chronic infections and malnutrition for endemic KS. Some environmental factors such as exposure to volcanic soils have been also hypothesized [77,78,79]. Chronic exposure of the skin to iron or alumino-silicate might induce localized immune dysfunction which might explain the topography of the lesions at the extremities of the body and its higher incidence in rural regions [77]. Additionally, some association with HLA [80] and other genetic factors with HHV8 infection susceptibility have been also postulated as predisposition factors for KS [81].Classic KS are usually indolent and progress slowly while AIDS KS are more aggressive [47]. In a recent retrospective monocentric study of endemic and classic KS (29 and 131, respectively) in France, endemic KS was associated with higher risk of systemic treatment, chemotherapeutic agent or immune-modulating therapies, and initiation than classic KS [82]. There is no staging classification of classic, endemic, and post-transplant KS. [59]. Treatments either local or systemic are offered to achieve KS control and preserve the quality of life of the patients based on several factors including KS lesions presentation (the number and the topography of the lesions, the presence of symptomatic lesions, and aggressiveness) but also on patient‚Äôs fitness. New therapeutics for KS will be covered by another article of this special issue. Recently, some European guidelines have been published to help clinicians to drive the therapeutic choices according to the clinical form and extension of the KS [59].  6. ConclusionsKS is a relatively rare tumor that is still endemic in southern and east Africa and has been associated with immunosuppression. KS is generally manageable by the introduction of antiretroviral treatment therapy for PLHIV or by reducing the immunosuppressive treatment for immunosuppressed organ-transplanted recipients. Current challenges in resource-poor settings are early HIV diagnosis, early treatment, and access to treatment to lower the KS burden in these contexts.

Abstract:
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a slow growing, low- to intermediate-grade dermal soft-tissue tumor. It has a high local recurrence rate but low metastatic potential. It is characterized by a uniform spindle cell arrangement, classically with a storiform pattern and CD34 immunoreactivity. The histomorphology and immunophenotype overlap with a broad range of other neoplasms. The standard treatment is complete surgical excision. The surgical procedures include wide local excision (WLE) with tumor free margins, Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) and amputation. Unresectable DFSPs are treated with radiation therapy and/or targeted therapy. DFSP has characteristic t(17; 22) (q22; q13), resulting in a COL1A1- PDGFB fusion transcripts in more than 90% of DFSPs. Molecular detection of the gene rearrangement or fusion transcripts is helpful for the diagnosis of patients with atypical morphology and for screening candidates for targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The aims of the present review are to update the clinical presentation, tumorigenesis and histopathology of DFSP and its variants for diagnosis and differential diagnosis from other benign and malignant tumors, to compare the advantages and drawbacks of WLE and MMS, to propose the baseline for selecting surgical procedure based on tumor‚Äôs location, size, stage and relationship with surrounding soft tissue and bone structures, and to provide a biologic rationale for the systemic therapy. We further propose a modified clinical staging system of DFSP and a surveillance program for the patients after surgical excision.

  1. IntroductionDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), derived from dermal fibroblasts, was initially characterized as keloid sarcoma. It was named as DFSP by Hoffman in 1925 [1]. Clinically, it is a slow-growing, low- to intermediate-grade malignant sarcoma and frequently occurs in middle-aged adults. Histopathologically, it is composed of uniform spindle cell fascicles growing in a storiform pattern with multiple variants and with strong and diffuse CD34 immunoreactivity. However, its spindle cell morphology and CD34 immunostaining pattern are overlapped with other benign and malignant lesions, which must be differentiated from. Ultrastructurally, DFSP is characterized by stellate or spindle cells, with long, slender, ramified cell processes joined by primitive junctions, which are similar to dermal dendrocytes [2]. Cytogenetically, more than 90% of DFSP have a t(17; 22) (q22; q13), leading to the formation of COL1A1-PDGFB fusion transcripts. Molecular detection of gene rearrangements or fusion transcripts is beneficial not only for the diagnosis in cases without typical morphology, but also for screening patients who are candidates for using imatinib mesylate (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that affects PDGFŒ≤R). This provides neoadjuvant targeted therapy for the patients with unresectable, recurrent or metastatic DFSP [3]. The standard treatment of resectable DFSPs is complete surgical excision with either wide local excision with tumor free margins or Mohs micrographic surgery, or, rarely, amputation. Each procedure has advantages and drawbacks. Unresectable DFSPs are treated with radiation therapy and/or targeted therapy. Accordingly, we update the DFSP‚Äôs clinical manifestations, histological features with its variants, diagnosis, differential diagnosis and tumorigenesis. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of different surgical procedures for resectable tumors and the width of margin resection. We review the biologic rationales of radiation therapy and/or targeted therapy for unresectable tumors. We also propose a modified staging system of DFSP for clinical practice and a surveillance program to monitor local recurrence and metastasis after surgical excision.  2. EpidemiologyDFSP is an uncommon, indolent dermal soft-tissue sarcoma that accounts for less than 0.1% of all malignancies and less than 1% of all soft-tissue sarcomas [4,5,6]. Two large epidemiological studies in the United States demonstrated that the annual incidence of DFSP was 4.2 per million people studied in a 30-year period from 1973 to 2002 [7], and 4.1 per million people in a 10-year period between 2000 and 2010 [8]. The incidence of DFSP is higher in women than men, and higher in African-American than white patients [4,5]. It most frequently occurs in young and middle-aged patients, between 25 and 45 years of age, with a mean age between 40 to 43 years [9,10]. However, patient‚Äôs age ranged widely from infancy to the elderly [11,12,13].  3. PathogenesisCytogenetic and molecular studies have demonstrated that more than 90% of DFSPs are characterized by either supernumerary ring chromosomes derived from chromosomes 17 and 22 or chromosomal translocation t(17; 22) (q22; q13), resulting in the fusion of collagen type 1-alpha 1(COL1A1 at 17q22) and platelet-derived growth factor beta (PDGFB at 22q13) genes. The gene fusion places the PDGFB gene under the control of the COL1A1 promoter [14,15,16], leading to PDGFŒ≤ overexpression and dimerization, and subsequently resulting in continuous activation of the PDGF receptor Œ≤ protein-tyrosine kinase [17]. Interaction of PDGFŒ≤ and PDGF receptor Œ≤ is involved in multiple signaling pathways including Ras mitogen-activated protein kinases (RAS-MARK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-akt-rapamycin (mTOR) (PI3K-AKT-mTOR) [18,19,20,21]. Correspondingly, increased expression of the phosphorylated Akt-mTOR pathway proteins including Akt, mTOR, 4EBP1, and S6RP and phosphor-PDGFRŒ±/Œ≤ have been demonstrated in about half of DFSP tissues by immunoperoxidase studies [21], suggesting that Akt-mTOR pathways are involved in the tumorigenesis of DFSP. Gene fusion transcript of COL1A1‚àíPDGFB can be detected by either fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues [22,23]. These are helpful for the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and guiding treatment of DFSP [24], especially when the tumor‚Äôs histomorphology is not typical or when the tyrosine kinase inhibitors are considered for treatment. The COL1A1-PDGFB fusion transcript cannot be detected in about 8% of DFSPs [15]. FISH analysis revealed genetic translocations involving the CSPG2 gene at 5q14.3 and PTK2B gene at 8p21.2 in a patient of DFSP without the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion transcript [16]. Other reported genetic translocations in DFSP include COL1A2-PDGFB [3], COL6A3-PDGFD [25] and elastin microfibril interface 2 (EMILIN2)-PDGFD [26]. Moreover, p53 mutation and overexpression, murine double minute 2 (MDM2) overexpression were reported in fibrosarcomatous variant of DFSP [17,27]. Furthermore, DFSPs were reported in patients with immunodeficiency disorders, including X-linked agammaglobulinemia [28], adenosine deaminase-deficient severe combined immune deficiency [29], ataxia telangiectasia syndrome [30] and HIV infection [31]. In addition, pregnancy may increase the risk for the development of DFSP [32]. These data suggest that multiple factors including oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and immunodeficiency are involved in the development of DFSP. Further investigation is required to understand the relationship of these risk factors to the development of DFSP.  4. Clinical CharacteristicsIn early stages of DFSP, the patient typically notices a slow-growing, small, firm, painless, skin-colored dermal plaque (Figure 1A,B), subcutaneous thickening or atrophic non-protuberant lesion [33,34]. Early pediatric DFSPs were classified into four variants: (1). Small palpable nodules slowly forming a confluent sclerotic plaque; (2). Keloid-like homogenous cutaneous thickening plaque; (3). Tumor ab initio and (4). Atrophic plaque [35]. Congenital DFSPs were reported as either erythematous atrophic plaque or irregular shaped, pigmented macula resembling melanocytic nevus after birth [34,36]. These congenital DFSPs carried the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion detected by either RT-PCR or FISH [34,36]. The early non-protuberant lesions gradually enlarge to form protuberant, indurated, reddish-blue or violaceous nodules in protuberant stages (Figure 2A‚ÄìC). If untreated, the tumors can locally invade more deeply into the fascia, muscle, periosteum, bone and occasionally metastasize to other organs in advanced stages [37]. The tumor cells most frequently metastasize to lung, brain, bone, visceral organs, lymph nodes and soft tissues [13,38,39,40]. This insidious growing process takes several months or years to as long as 60 years [13,33,34]. The reported tumor sizes vary in a wide range from 0.5 to >10 cm in diameter, with a mean of 2‚Äì3.5 cm [41,42]. Most DFSPs are localized on the trunk (40‚Äì50%), followed by proximal extremities (30‚Äì40%), and then the head and neck (10‚Äì15%) [43,44,45]. Infrequently documented cases have been reported on the toes [22,46,47,48,49], scalp [50], breast [51,52,53] and vulva [54].  5. Clinical and Imaging EvaluationIn addition to a thorough history and physical examination, diagnosis of suspected DFSP ideally requires a generous biopsy (punch biopsy or excisional biopsy) for a pathologic diagnosis. The pathology report should note the presence of fibrosarcomatous change or other high-risk features. Examination of lymph nodes and imaging studies are important for staging and surgical planning.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) delineates tumor‚Äôs size and extent, and its relationship with adjacent neuromuscular structures and bone (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5A,B). MRI is therefore recommended for pre-operative evaluation, surgical planning and follow-up for recurrence [55,56]. MR T1-weighted images exhibit well-defined homogeneous isointense lesions, while T2-weighted images show a well-defined subcutaneous soft tissue nodules or mass with intermediate-to-marked homogeneous hyperintensity to the surrounding muscular tissues (Figure 4A,B) [57]. Poorly defined irregular margins can be observed in some cases (Figure 4B) [58]. High frequency ultrasound can be used to evaluate the extent of the tumor involvement as well as provide biopsy guidance. The ultrasound of DFSP often appears as a hypoechoic superficial nodular mass [59,60]. Computed tomography (CT) reveals a solitary, subcutaneous lobular or nodular architecture and soft tissue attenuation and post-contrast enhancement (Figure 5C,D) [61]. Intratumoral non-enhancement areas in large tumors (>5 cm) may suggest necrosis and cystic degeneration. CT is useful to evaluate distant metastatic disease. The technique of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose‚Äìpositron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) has shown potential value in both identifying metastatic disease and evaluating treatment response [61,62,63]. X-rays have no role in the imaging of the primary DFSP.  6. Pathologic diagnosisGrossly, DFSP is commonly a white to yellow color, poorly circumscribed, soft-tissue mass without a smooth outer surface. The cut surface is white to yellow, poorly encapsulated, solid and a fish flesh-like texture (Figure 2D and Figure 6). Hemorrhagic and/or cystic changes can be observed in larger tumors (>5 cm). All sides of margins need to be labeled and grossed to examine if any part of the margins contains tumor cells or not (Figure 6).Histologically, DFSP is derived from fibroblasts in the dermis and subsequently it can infiltrate into the subcutaneous tissues or it can develop directly from subcutaneous tissues [64]. In non-protuberant stage I with dermal plaque or subcutaneous thickening, the elongated spindle cells are loosely scattered in the upper dermis without involving grenz zone (Figure 7A). In stage II and later with protuberant lesions, DFSP is typically featured with uniformly monomorphous spindle cells, with little atypia and mitotic activity, arranged in a storiform pattern, in the subcutaneous and dermal layers (Figure 7C). The cellular nuclei are elongated with mild hyperchromasia, small to inconspicuous nucleoli and low to moderate quantities of cytoplasm. The neoplastic cells often infiltrate into subcutaneous adipose tissue in a honeycomb pattern (Figure 7D). This poses challenge to determine the true extent of the tumor tissue. All margins need to be carefully grossed and examined for residual tumor cells (Figure 6). Immunohistochemically, spindle cells typically show strong and diffuse cytoplasmic expression of CD34 (Figure 7B), but negative expression for other immunohistochemical stains, such as alpha-smooth muscle actin, factor XIIIa, S-100 and melan-A. It should be noted that CD34 expression could be reduced or even lost in up to 45% of the fibrosarcomatous DFSP (Figure 7I) [13,65]. CD34 expression is not unique to DFSP. Other tumors, including spindle cell lipomas, fibromas, fibromyxomas and Kaposi sarcomas, also express CD34.DFSPs have multiple histological variants including myxoid (Figure 7E), pigmented, giant cell (Figure 7F), giant cell fibroblastoma, granular cell, sclerotic (Figure 7G) and fibrosarcomatous (FS) component (Figure 7H, Table 1). These variants reflect the morphologic heterogeneity which is associated with the spindle cell differentiation during tumor development. They do not bear significant clinical manifestations and outcomes, except for the FS variant with increased risk of local recurrence and metastatic potential [28].DFSP without FS component is categorized as classic or conventional DFSP, accounting for 80‚Äì90% of all DFSPs [66]. It is considered a low-grade malignancy with a propensity of local recurrences following resection, but almost no metastatic potential [67,68]. FS-DFSP is featured with atypical spindle cells with significantly increased mitotic activity arranged in a herringbone pattern (Figure 7H), often with reduced or even loss of CD34 expression (Figure 7I), but increased Ki-67 expression (a marker of cellular proliferation) [13]. FS-DFSPs consisting of 10‚Äì20% of DFSPs are considered intermediate-grade sarcoma with a higher metastatic risk (5‚Äì15%) [13,67]. Analysis of 24 reports containing 1422 patients with DFSP and 225 with FS-DFSP revealed that FS-DFSPs, compared with classic DFSPs, had a significantly higher risks of local recurrence (29.8% vs 13.7%, risk ratio 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.7‚Äì2.9)); metastasis (14.4% vs 1.1%, risk ratio 5.5 (95% confidence interval 4.3‚Äì7.0)); and death from disease (14.7% vs 0.8%, risk ratio 6.2 (95% confidence interval 5.0‚Äì7.8)) [66].  7. Differential diagnosisSimilarities in clinical manifestations and overlaps in histopathologic and CD34 immunostaining profiles with other tumors require DFSP to be differentiated from other benign and malignant lesions including dermatofibroma, schwannoma, cutaneous neurofibroma, solitary fibrous tumor, intradermal spindle cell lipoma and spindle cell or desmoplastic melanoma. Detailed evaluation of the clinical presentation and morphologic features with immunohistochemistry are needed to make an accurate diagnosis (Table 2). Difficult cases can be further tested by molecular techniques including FISH and RT-PCR to detect gene rearrangements and gene fusion transcripts in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumor tissues [79].  8. Clinical Staging SystemNo standard staging system of DFSP is available [86]. We propose a modified staging system of DFSP based on European consensus-based interdisciplinary guideline [86], the progression of DFSPs‚Äô tumorigenesis and clinical presentation, as shown in Table 3. This staging system is useful for treatment.  9. Treatment  9.1. Treatment of Resectable DFSPSurgical excision is the standard treatment of DFSP including stage I and II, even III and IV whenever feasible. Wide undermining following surgical excision is not advisable as it may seed tumor in incomplete resections and also may cause difficulty in interpreting subsequent re-excisions. Initial resected tumors with positive margins or relapsed/recurrent tumors need to be further resected to achieve wide clear margins whenever possible [41]. Surgical reconstruction should be delayed until all margins are confirmed negative by complete peripheral and deep margin examination. If concern exists for positive surgical margins following wide excision, a split thickness skin graft may be placed to facilitate monitoring for recurrence.Surgical techniques include wide local excision (WLE) with tumor-free margins, Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) (Figure 1B‚ÄìD and Figure 9B‚ÄìD), partial or total amputation if the tumor is located on the upper or lower digits [28,87,88]. Both WLE and MMS are used in the clinical practice and each has advantages and drawbacks, as summarized in Table 4.Multiple studies have shown that MMS can significantly lower the risk of recurrence of DFSP, compared with WLE [88,90,91]. A comprehensive retrospective meta-analysis involving 684 patients of DFSP published on Medline from 2008 to 2018 revealed that the recurrence rates of DFSP treated with WLE and MMS were 9.10% and 2.72%, respectively, with mean follow-ups of 5.32 years for both groups [92]. Lowe et al. reported the Mayo Clinic experience illustrating a 30.8% recurrence rate following WLE and 3.0% with Mohs surgery; primary closure was performed following MMS in 73% of cases, vs. flaps, graft and other closures in 52% of the WLE cases [90]. Multidisciplinary management is advantageous with infiltrative DFSP of the head and neck as well as large tumors on the trunk, where the Mohs surgeon does the tumor mapping and histologic examination of all tumor margins in concert with another ablative surgeon (Figure 9) [93].The width of the tumor free margins is an important factor to be considered for complete excision for both WLE and MMS. However, no agreement on optimal width of margins is available. NCCN guidelines (version 1.2020) suggest 2‚Äì4 cm lateral margins from the tumor and the excision of the investing fascia to remove any infiltrating tumor in WLE [94]. Ratner et al analyzed records of 58 patients with primary and recurrent DFSP treated with Mohs surgery and reported that 70% had positive margins with a 1 cm margin, 39.7% with 2 cm, 15.5% with 3 cm and 5.2% with 5 cm margins [95]. The reported local recurrence (LR) rates with width margins varied widely. Monnier et al. reported a LR of 47% in 66 patients with width margins less than 3 cm at a mean follow-up of 32 months [96], whereas Farma et al. reported LR of 0.9% in 206 patients using 2 cm margins at a follow-up of 64 months [97]. Snow at al recently reported a LR of 1% and a distal recurrence of 1% in 98 patients at a follow-up of 53 months [98]. Among them, 44 patients with microscopically incompletely excised DFSP were treated with conservative re-excision with a mean width of 1.54 cm, and 54 patients with primary tumors were excised with a mean margin of 2.4 cm [98]. Harati analyzed 68 patients with DFSP and observed that 2 cm width margins of normal tissues in primary tumors and in incompletely resected tissues around the scar yielded median negative margins of 0.35 cm and 0.8 cm [99], respectively. These data suggest that narrower margins may be good enough to prevent local recurrence. Mullen suggests to choose WLE with a 1.0 to 1.5 cm safe margins from tumor boundary for most DFSPs on the trunk or extremities since the tumor can be excised in a single stage to achieve excellent cosmetic and functional outcomes, whereas MMS should be selected for relatively small DFSPs in cosmetically sensitive regions including face, scalp (Figure 1B‚ÄìD) and neck, for best tissue preservation, cosmetic and functional outcomes [89].Dissection of the tumor bed should be based on the infiltrating depth of the tumor. Deep tumors (Stage IIB) should be excised to include the underlying investing fascia of muscle or pericranium whereas superficial tumors (Stage I + IIA) may be directly excised without dissecting underlying fascia. Since WLE usually requires wide and deep excision from the periphery of the tumor, this makes it difficult to treat the DFSP on digits due to the limited space and the complex structures surrounding the toes and fingers. Mohs surgery may allow tissue sparing for DFSP of the digits, however if tumor extends to periosteum, partial or total amputation of the involved digit will be necessary to obtain tumor-free margins and allows for primary closure with faster return to function [22]. When the patient does not agree with amputation due to concern of functional and cosmetic impairments, tumor can be directly enucleated as demonstrated in Figure 2C,D. The patient needs to be referred to oncologists for further radiation therapy and/or targeted therapy. In surgical practice, selection of which procedure for individual patient must be based on tumor location, size, stage, relationship with surrounding neuro-muscular and bone structures, cosmetic and functional requirements, cost to the patient and the medical resources.  9.2. Treatment of FS-DFSPThe FS-DFSP variant is a much more aggressive tumor with local recurrence in more than 50% of patients and metastasis in 10% to 15% of patients [13,100]. FS-DFSP treatment needs consultation with a multidisciplinary specialized soft-tissue sarcoma tumor board [86]. Aggressive treatments for FS-DFSP include adequate WLE with clear surgical margins or MMS (Figure 1B‚ÄìD). Adjuvant radiotherapy and targeted therapy may be used to reduce the incidence of both local recurrence and metastasis [101].  9.3. Treatment of Unresectable/Metastatic DFSPUnresectable DFSPs include advanced stage tumors, recurrent tumors without any possibility for further resection due to the size and/or location, or tumors in which further resection is likely to cause severe functional or cosmetic defects as shown in Figure 2C,D, and multiple organ metastases. These tumors should be treated with adjuvant radiation and/or targeted therapy in consultation with a multidisciplinary specialized soft-tissue sarcoma tumor board. Metastatic DFSP may also be treated with single or multiple agent chemotherapy regimens that are used for sarcomas.  9.3.1. Radiation TherapyMultiple studies have shown that DFSP is a radio-responsive tumor and adjuvant radiation therapy is effective to control tumor growth and reduce the incidence of postoperative recurrence [102,103,104,105,106]. A retrospective analysis of 53 DFSP patients treated with surgery and either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy in the MD Anderson Cancer Center showed disease-free survival rates of 98% and 93% at 5 and 10 years, respectively [105]. A total of 60 Gy for indeterminate or microscopic positive margins and up to 70 Gy for macroscopic positive margins or primary gross tumor should be given [86,94]. The radiation field should extend 3‚Äì5 cm beyond the surgical margins or primary tumor boundary whenever feasible. An individual dose can be given at 2 Gy daily, 5 times weekly [86,94].  9.3.2. Targeted TherapyImatinib mesylate (IM) is a potent and specific protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor interfering with the phosphorylation and activation of the PDGF receptor Œ≤ which is constitutively activated due to translocation and fusion between PDGFB and COL1A1 genes as discussed in Pathogenesis section. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that IM had growth-inhibitory effects on DFSP [60,61]. The effectiveness was evidenced by decreased tumor cellularity and formation of strong hyalinic fibrosis in tissues responded to IM treatment [107]. Treatment with IM in FS-DFSP revealed significant upregulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21Cip1 and Œ≤-galactosidase (a marker of cellular senescence) but decreased Ki-67 [108]. These data suggest that IM therapy is involved in modulation of tumor cell senescent and proliferative activities. IM may also play a role in immune modulation in tumor tissues. IM treated FS-DFSP tumor tissues compared with untreated tissues exhibited increased infiltration of the CD4 and CD8 T-cells in accompany with increased upregulation of cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, transforming growth factor-Œ≤1, CXCL-1, IL-1Œ≤ and IL-8 and CD163+CD14+ myeloid cells transforming to express CD209 [108]. CD163+ macrophages are known to downregulate immune response whereas CD209+ myeloid cells promote T-cell-mediated antitumor responses. These data suggest that IM may exert direct antitumor effects via targeting the PDGFR pathway and indirect antitumor effects via T-cell mediated immune-modulation.The efficacy of IM was observed in localized and metastatic DFSP with t(17; 22), but not in FS-DFSP lacking t(17; 22) [39,109,110,111]. A systemic review of IM treatment of 152 older patients (mean age: 49.3 years) with locally advanced (mean size: 9.9 cm in diameter) or metastatic DFSPs revealed 5.2% of patients with complete response (CR), 55.2% with partial response (PR), 27.6% in stable condition (SC) and 9.2% with progression. There were no differences in response rate using 400-mg or 800-mg daily doses for those with complete or partial responses [112]. A multicenter phase II trial of neoadjuvant IM therapy in advanced primary or locally recurrent DFSP resulted in 7.1% patients with CR, 50.0% with PR, 35.7% with SC and 7.1% with progression [107].Further studies showed that IM used as a preoperative adjuvant therapy in DFSP lead to median tumor volume shrinkages from 20% to 31.5% [39,107,113,114], which transformed very large, unresectable tumors into resectable ones. Wang et al. reported four of 10 patients with primarily unresectable DFSP received complete surgical resection following IM treatment [38]. These studies provide new treatment options for patients with unresectable, recurrent, advanced and metastatic DFSP.It should be noted that about 10% of DFSPs do not respond to IM treatment [38,107,112,115]. Some patients initially responding to IM treatment develop secondary resistance to IM rapidly [115,116]. Therefore, surgical excision for advanced primary tumor following IM therapy should be performed expeditiously during the ‚Äúshrinkage window‚Äù.The mechanism of resistance to IM is not clear yet. A low PDGFR phosphorylation level observed in IM resistant tumor tissues may not respond to IM [107,115]. Sunitinib, with its binding capacity of 10 times greater than that of IM, was demonstrated to be effective in IM resistant DFSP patients [107,115]. However, this effect may not be solely due to inhibiting PDFGR since Sunitinib is a multikinase inhibitor targeting not only PDGFR, but also vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1‚Äì3, KIT, colony stimulating factor-1 receptor and FMS-like tyrosine-kinase-3 (FLT3) [117]. Other gene mutations or signal pathways may play a role in IM resistance. Whole-genomic sequencing in a patient with resistance to IM identified 8 nonsynonymous somatic gene mutations, including ACAP2, CARD10, KIAA0556, PAAQR7, PPP1R39, SAFB2, STARD9 and ZFYVE9 [118]. Single nucleotide polymorphism array and sequencing analysis of DFSP105 (an imatinib-resistant human cell line established from a FS-DFSP) showed a localized 9p21 homozygous deletion, encompassing CDKN2A and CDKN2B, which encode p14ARF, p15INK4b and p16INK4a [119]. p16 inhibits CDK4/6 activity. Loss of p16 expression leads to unrestricted cell cycle progression. Selection of new clonal cells after treatment with either immunotherapy or radiotherapy may also take a part in IM resistant treatment [120].In the cases of IM resistance, other multikinase inhibitors, including sunitinib [107], sorafenib [121] and pazopanib [122], can be considered since treatment with these inhibitors showed effectiveness in IM resistant DFSP patients. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibitors PD-0332991 and LEE011 in inhibiting DFSP105 proliferation, suggesting that CDK4/6 inhibitors can be potential drugs in p16 negative FS-DFSP [119]. Loss of p16 expression was demonstrated in 2 of 12 classic DFSP and 2 of 6 FS-DFSP [119]. Programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) expression was detected in metastatic FS-DFSP, but not in the primary tumor, suggesting a role of PD-L1 in the metastasis of FS-DFSP [123]. Since PD-L1 expression in the tumor cells is involved in immune escape from T cell attack [124], PD-L1 signal pathway may be a potential target for metastatic FS-DFSP.  10. Prognosis and SurveillanceThe prognoses of the patients with DFSP, after surgical resection with negative and sometimes even positive microscopic margins, are generally good. The five- and ten-year recurrence-free survival rates of DFSP are 86% and 76% [44], respectively. Increased age, high mitotic index, positive margins and increased cellularity are predictors of poor clinical outcome [43]. Local recurrence is a major concern after surgical excision. The frequencies of local recurrences ranged from 20% to 50% [41,44], especially with positive margins. The median time from excision to local recurrence was reported from 32 to 38 months [43,44]. Therefore, mandatory long-term surveillance, at an interval of 6 to 12 months, is recommended [43]. Several studies suggest patients should be reevaluated every 6 months for the first five years and then yearly thereafter [86,99]. A thorough history and clinical examination of the primary sites and draining lymph nodes should be performed at each visit. Further imaging examinations should be considered based on patient‚Äôs tumor‚Äôs clinical manifestations (size, site, location, rate of growth), surgical procedures and histopathology (presence of high-risk features and margin status). Biopsy should be done on suspected local or distant recurrences or lymph node metastasis.  11. ConclusionsDFSP is a low- to intermediate-grade malignancy frequently occurring in the young to middle-aged population. It is histologically characterized by bland spindle cells in a storiform pattern with multiple variants. This needs to be differentiated from other benign and malignant lesions. A vast majority harbor t(17; 22) (q22; q13) resulting in the formation of COL1A1-PDGFB fusion gene transcript, which holds not only diagnostic value, but also therapeutic significance. WLE with a safe margin should be selected for most DFSPs located on the trunk and extremities. MMS should be considered for relatively small DFSPs in cosmetically sensitive regions to achieve the best tissue preservation with more appealing cosmetic and functional recoveries and can also be used for medium to large DFSP of the trunk and extremities with high cure rates. Subtotal or total digital amputation should be considered for DFSPs located on the digits where complete surgical excision is impractical. Adjuvant therapies‚Äîincluding radiation and targeted therapy‚Äîshould be chosen for the patients who are unsuitable for surgical excision. Periodic surveillance, at an interval of 6 months in the first five years and then yearly post-excision, is recommended to monitor potential recurrence and metastasis.

    Comparison between wide local excision (WLE) and Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS).

Comparable Parameter WLEMMSSurgical procedures [87,88]A three-dimensional excision including normal skin, subcutaneous tissue and the underlying investing fascia within a 2‚Äì4 cm margins from the gross tumor boundaryA stepwise procedure of tumor removal with mapping, histopathologic examination of 100% of the margins with tangential frozen sections by the Mohs surgeon and further deeper and/or wider re-excision of another layer of surrounding tissues if residual tumor cells are visualized. This procedure is repeated until all tumor margins are free of tumor cells. Usually performed as an outpatient with local anesthesia (Figure 9)Advantages [87]Relative simpler procedureImmediate wound repair following tumor removalCost effective for patients and medical resources (but additional cost is incurred if positive margins need to be addressed)Precise and complete evaluation of 100% of the surgical margins during excision; wound repair done when clear margins are obtainedLower rates of local recurrence compared with surgical excisionDrawbacks [87]Unable to evaluate surgical margins during surgical operationHigher rate of local recurrences compared to Mohs surgeryNeeds specialized training for Mohs surgeons and coordination with in office histotechnologistsDelayed closure (usually same day) to allow for pathologic evaluationTime consuming and labor intensiveMay have higher cost for patients and medical resourcesApplications [89]Best for primary DFSPs on the trunk or extremities with a 2‚Äì4 cm margin from tumor boundary to completely excise tumor with acceptable cosmesis and function in a single operationIdeal for DFSPs in cosmetically and functionally sensitive regions including face, scalp, neck, genitalia and digits to preserve tissue for optimal cosmetic reconstruction and functional recoveries and may be utilized in trunk and extremity DFSP

AbstractSebaceous carcinoma (SC) is a very rare and aggressive form of skin cancer that arises from the sebaceous glands. SC can occur anywhere on the body, but most commonly affects the head and neck, especially the upper eyelid. SC is the third most common malignancy of the eyelid and has the potential to metastasize and be fatal; therefore, it is vital for dermatologists to remain acquainted with this malignancy and its most current treatment options. Most commonly presenting as a painless lump or thickening of skin on the eyelid, SC has an insidious progression that may not prompt the patient to seek medical attention immediately. To avoid the potential of metastasis, early diagnosis and treatment is paramount. To assess if the cancer has spread, ophthalmology, imaging, and sentinel lymph node biopsy are recommended. This article provides a comprehensive review of SC‚Äôs pathogenesis, current diagnostic methods, and treatments, including wide local excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, orbital exenteration, radiation, and other topicals. The prognosis of SC depends on several factors, including size, location, stage, and treatment method. After treatment of the neoplasm, diligent post-treatment surveillance remains the cornerstone of patient care. Continued dermatologic follow-ups are essential for early detection of reoccurrence, ensuring timely intervention and optimal long-term outcomes. In conclusion, this comprehensive review aims to equip dermatologists and other physicians with a nuanced understanding of SC, enabling them to provide effective care to support patients encountering this malignancy.

Abstract


Sebaceous carcinoma is an aggressive skin cancer with a 5-year overall survival rate of 78% for localized/regional disease and 50% for metastatic disease. The incidence of this cancer has been increasing in the United States for several decades, but the underlying reasons for this increase are unclear. In this article, we review the epidemiology and genetics of sebaceous carcinoma, including recent population data and tumor genomic analyses that provide new insights into underlying tumor biology. We further discuss emerging evidence of a possible viral etiology for this cancer. Finally, we review the clinical implications of recent advances in sebaceous carcinoma research for screening, prevention, and treatment.






Introduction


Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare skin cancer that arises from the sebaceous oil gland. Individuals with this cancer have a 5-year overall survival rate of 78% for localized/regional disease and 50% for metastatic disease (1‚Äì3). In addition to its aggressive behavior, treatment-related morbidity for sebaceous carcinoma can also be significant because tumors predominantly occur on the head and neck, with oncologic management often requiring complex facial reconstruction and radiotherapy (1, 2, 4‚Äì6). Therefore, it is critically important to understand the epidemiology and biology of this rare cancer to improve early detection and to reduce morbidity and mortality for patients.


In this article, we review the current state of sebaceous carcinoma research, including several recent studies highlighting the importance of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and immunosuppression as risk factors for tumor development and the possibility of a viral etiology. We also summarize the clinical implications of this research for screening, prevention, and treatment of sebaceous carcinoma.


Epidemiology


Sebaceous carcinoma incidence has been increasing in the United States since 1973 when the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registries started collecting tumor data (1, 4, 7). From 2000 through 2016, the overall incidence for sebaceous carcinoma was 2.4 cases per million persons, with an average of 800 cases per year in the United States (7). Incidence is also higher for males (3.5 cases/million persons) than females (1.7 cases/million persons), and increases with age, with the highest incidence observed among individuals ‚â•80 years old (22.7 cases/million persons; ref. 7). Seventy-eight percent of cases occur in non-Hispanic whites, who have approximately a 4-fold greater incidence than African Americans (7).


Sebaceous Carcinoma Risk Factors


Figure 1 summarizes known and suspected risk factors for sebaceous carcinoma.


Figure 1.View largeDownload slideSummary diagram of known and possible risk factors for sebaceous carcinoma. Population data analyses have identified several risk factors for sebaceous carcinoma, which are listed in the figure. The highly elevated risk for sebaceous carcinoma among immunosuppressed populations (solid organ transplant recipients and individuals with HIV infection), which is similar to the elevation observed for other virus-associated cancers (Kaposi sarcoma and Merkel cell carcinoma), suggests that sebaceous carcinoma may also be caused by a virus. In addition to causing cancer in immunosuppressed patients (pathway A), an oncogenic virus could also promote tumorigenesis in immunocompetent patients (pathway B). Among individuals with Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome, higher ambient UVR exposure is associated with an increased risk for sebaceous carcinoma, in addition to being an independent risk factor for this cancer type.Figure 1.View largeDownload slideSummary diagram of known and possible risk factors for sebaceous carcinoma.

DNA mismatch repair and microsatellite instability


Pathogenic germline variants of DNA mismatch repair genes (MSH2, MSH6, and MLH1) have been identified in 8%‚Äì29% of individuals with sebaceous carcinoma (8‚Äì11). These variants also cause hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome, also known as Lynch syndrome, and affected individuals have an increased risk for additional malignancies affecting the skin (keratoacanthomas) and internal organs (gastrointestinal and genitourinary). Patients with sebaceous carcinoma and other cancers caused by germline mutations of DNA mismatch repair genes are classified as having a specific form of nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome called Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome (OMIM 158320). Tumors in these patients are characterized by microsatellite instability (12, 13).


Given the highly elevated risk for multiple cancer types in patients with Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome (12) and the relatively low incidence of sebaceous neoplasms in the general population, several prior studies (10, 14, 15) have recommended performing mismatch repair IHC staining of all sebaceous neoplasms to screen for possible underlying germline mutations (10, 14, 15). Moreover, identifying tumors with these mutations may also have implications for treatment; the immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody), is approved by the FDA for the treatment of solid tumors in adults and children with microsatellite instability caused by defective DNA mismatch repair (16‚Äì19).


UVR


Population and tumor data also implicate UVR as a risk factor for sebaceous carcinoma. In the United States, 73% of cases occur on chronically sun-exposed skin of the head and neck and 85% of tumors are diagnosed in white (non-Hispanic, 78% and Hispanic, 7%) patients, who lack significant amounts of photoprotective melanin pigment in their skin (7). Furthermore, evaluation of ambient UVR exposure, as assessed by geographic location of residence, revealed an increased risk for sebaceous carcinoma among individuals with and without Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome (7). In addition, one-third of tumors have been found to manifest significant solar damage with >25% of the mutations in these tumors exhibiting a UVR mutational signature (20). Despite the growing body of evidence implicating UVR in sebaceous carcinoma tumorigenesis, definitive evidence of an etiologic role will require larger tumor-based analyses to further evaluate UVR mutational signatures and cancer driver genes, as well as clinical studies demonstrating a reduction in sebaceous carcinoma risk with sun-protective behavior (applying sunscreen, wearing a hat, etc.) among at-risk populations (e.g., Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome).


Immunosuppression


Recently, immunosuppression has been identified as a strong risk factor for sebaceous carcinoma. Among individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), there is an 8-fold elevation in risk for this cancer (21). Similarly, an elevation in sebaceous carcinoma risk has also been observed for solid organ transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy (22, 23). D'Arcy and colleagues evaluated the incidence of rare cancer types among solid organ transplant recipients using data from the Transplant Cancer Match (TCM) Study, which links the U.S. solid organ transplant recipient registry with 18 population-based cancer registries (24, 25), and identified 62 cases of sebaceous carcinoma among 262,455 transplant recipients, which corresponded to a 34-fold elevation in risk compared with the general population (22). In a subsequent study using updated TCM Study data, which included 102 cases of sebaceous carcinoma diagnosed among 301,075 transplant recipients and covering approximately half of all the U.S. transplant procedures performed from 1987 through 2017, we identified a slightly lower, but still highly elevated risk (25-fold) for sebaceous carcinoma in this immunosuppressed population (23). Among transplant patients, a posttransplant diagnosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, longer time since transplant, and induction therapy with thymoglobulin were each associated with an increased risk for sebaceous carcinoma (23). Moreover, the association between squamous cell carcinoma, caused by UVR-induced DNA damage, and increased sebaceous carcinoma risk suggests that UVR photodamage of the skin contributes to sebaceous carcinoma tumorigenesis in transplant patients.


Possible Viral Etiology?


The strongly increased risk for sebaceous carcinoma among people with AIDS and solid organ transplant recipients is similar to that of other virus-induced cancers, such as Merkel cell carcinoma (caused by Merkel cell polyomavirus; refs. 26, 27) and Kaposi sarcoma (caused by Kaposi sarcoma‚Äìassociated herpesvirus/human herpes virus 8; refs. 24, 28), which suggests that sebaceous carcinoma may also be caused by a viral infection. However, direct evidence supporting a viral agent has been contradictory. The first evidence of viral involvement in sebaceous carcinoma was reported in 1994 by Hayashi and colleagues, who identified human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, and 33 by DNA ISH in nine of 13 (62%) sebaceous carcinomas (29). However, subsequent studies generally failed to identify HPV in sebaceous carcinomas, with only one HPV-positive case observed of 85 (1.2%) examined by PCR, RNA ISH, or DNA ISH (30‚Äì33). Very recently, 4 of 29 patients (14%) with TP53 and RB1 wild-type sebaceous carcinomas were reported to harbor ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù HPV types, as detected by RNA ISH. Furthermore, in 2 of these patients, RNA-sequencing confirmed the presence of HPV16 and HPV18, with no other viruses detected (34).


Further complicating the story of a potential viral etiology in sebaceous carcinoma is that multiple viruses have been implicated. Collisions between Merkel cell carcinomas and sebaceous carcinomas, where both tumors occur simultaneously at the same anatomic site, have been reported, raising the possibility of the involvement of Merkel cell polyomavirus (35). Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus also was recently reported in 26% of sebaceous carcinomas in China, as detected by ISH for the viral RNA, EBER (36). Finally, genus Beta papillomaviruses, also known as cutaneous papillomaviruses, have been proposed as suspects because of their potential involvement in the development of other nonmelanoma skin cancers, especially in immunosuppressed patients (37, 38). Various studies in cell culture and mouse models have now demonstrated that the E6 and E7 oncoproteins of Beta papillomaviruses can tolerize cells to UV-mediated mutagenesis (39, 40). However, another report indicated that Beta papillomaviruses, which are a common component of normal skin flora, may be protective against nonmelanoma skin cancers in immunocompetent individuals (41).


Ultimately, due to the conflicting reports to date and the likely complexity of potential viral involvement in sebaceous carcinoma, several clear lines of evidence will be needed to bring clarity. The first step toward resolution will require comprehensive identification and quantification of viral nucleic acids from tumors of immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients with sebaceous carcinoma by unbiased DNA and RNA-sequencing. Candidate oncoviruses will have to be further validated for the expression of gene products spatially within tumors either by IHC or RNA scope. Animal and cellular models will also need to be developed to study the mechanisms of virus-mediated sebaceous carcinoma oncogenesis with subsequent comparison of these results against patient data. Finally, conclusive evidence will come if prevention of the candidate oncovirus prevents the disease or its precursor especially in at-risk individuals.


Sebaceous Carcinoma Genomics


Although rare, several small case series have assessed the mutational profile of sebaceous carcinomas. North and colleagues performed whole-exome sequencing of 32 sebaceous carcinomas [23 cutaneous tumors and nine ocular (eyelid) tumors] and identified three molecular subtypes (20). The first subtype, characterized by a prominent UVR mutational signature and a high tumor mutation burden (>50 mutations/Megabase), was observed in 10 cases (31%). A second subtype demonstrated prominent microsatellite instability and was observed in nine tumors (28%), of which seven had somatic mutations of mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6). In addition, one case with microsatellite instability also had a pathogenic germline mutation of MSH6. The last subtype (13 cases, 41%) consisted of pauci-mutational tumors with mutations of ZNF750 observed in nine of the 13 cases (69%). The transcriptomes and anatomic distribution of UVR-mediated sebaceous carcinomas closely resembled those of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, leading the authors to postulate that epidermal keratinocytes (cell of origin for cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas) may be the cell of origin for some sebaceous carcinomas. Further supporting this hypothesis was the identification of frequent mutations of ZNF750, a lineage-specific tumor suppressor in squamous cell carcinoma (42), among pauci-mutational tumors.


Recently, Tetzlaff and colleagues performed next-generation sequencing for a targeted panel of 409 cancer-related genes in 29 primary or locally recurrent ocular adnexal (eyelid) sebaceous carcinomas (34). Their analysis identified two molecular subtypes: tumors with TP53 mutations (19 cases, 66%) harboring concomitant genetic alterations of RB1 (13/19 cases with TP53 mutations) and tumors that were wild-type for both genes. In a subsequent study, Xu and colleagues performed whole-exome sequencing of 31 ocular adnexal sebaceous carcinomas and also identified TP53 mutations in the majority of tumors (22 cases, 71%) with concomitant mutations of RB1 (10 cases), ZNF750 (10 cases), and NOTCH1 (seven cases) in a subset of cases (43). Six tumors lacked mutations of all four genes (TP53, RB1, ZNF750, and NOTCH1). Mutations of PCDH15 were identified in five tumors (three cases with TP53 mutations; one case lacking mutations of TP53, RB1, ZNF750, and NOTCH1), of which four subsequently metastasized (43). However, additional studies are necessary to validate PCDH15 as a prognostic biomarker including whether mutations of this gene are observed among nonocular cases.


These genomic studies had several limitations. Each study analyzed a relatively small number of cases, and therefore, may have been underpowered to detect less common, but biologically significant genetic alterations involved in tumor development and progression. In addition, two studies (34, 43) were composed entirely of ocular cases; therefore, the genetic alterations identified may not be representative of nonocular cases, which account for the majority of tumors (1, 4, 7). Finally, none of the prior studies searched for differences in the genetic alterations of tumors from immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients.


Clinical Implications of Sebaceous Carcinoma Research


Management of sebaceous carcinoma


The first-line treatment for sebaceous carcinoma at all sites (periocular and extraocular) is Mohs micrographic surgery or wide-local excision according to recently published clinical practice guidelines developed by an expert panel of researchers and clinicians (44). Periocular tumors may require orbital exenteration if there is extensive involvement of underlying orbital or periorbital structures (44). A sentinel lymph node biopsy may also be performed for periocular tumors to evaluate the extent of disease for stage IIC or higher tumors, which have a 15% positivity rate for metastasis (44, 45). For cases with nodal metastasis, adjuvant radiotherapy is sometimes used with unclear benefit to treat the nodal basin (46). In contrast, routine sentinel lymph node biopsy is often not recommended for extraocular sebaceous carcinomas given the low (<1% in SEER registries) positivity rate for metastasis (44, 47). Adjuvant radiotherapy can be considered for individual cases of extraocular sebaceous carcinoma with perineural invasion, positive surgical margins, or positive nodal basins, but evidence is insufficient regarding its efficacy (44). For advanced or unresectable tumors with microsatellite instability or a high tumor mutation burden, the FDA has approved treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (17‚Äì19, 48). However, treatments specifically approved by the FDA for sebaceous carcinoma are lacking.


Reducing immunosuppression, such as lowering the dosage of antirejection medications for transplant recipients and adjusting/starting antiretroviral therapy for individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to increase CD4 counts, may also slow down tumor growth and progression of disease. However, for transplant patients, the potential benefit of reducing immunosuppression must be balanced against the risk of graft rejection.


Screening and prevention


Current management guidelines for patients with Lynch syndrome, developed by a Multi-Society Task Force in 2014, do not include skin cancer screening as part of long-term management and follow-up (49). However, several studies have recommended periodic skin cancer screening for individuals with Lynch syndrome (12) given their highly elevated risk for sebaceous carcinoma. Most guidelines (50) also recommend skin cancer screening following solid organ transplantation because of the highly elevated risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, however, the frequency of surveillance is often not specified. While performing total body skin exams of transplant patients as part of their routine follow-up care, physicians should carefully screen for sebaceous carcinoma, which may have a yellowish appearance because of the tumor's increased lipid content (5). There should also be consideration of more frequent exams for transplant recipients with multiple risk factors for sebaceous carcinoma. Factors influencing screening frequency among transplant patients may include evidence of skin with severe photodamage, prior history of skin cancer, duration of immunosuppression, exposure to thymoglobulin, and exposure to photosensitizing medications, such as voriconazole (23, 51). Screening should also be considered for non-white patients, who may not be routinely surveilled for skin cancer, if they have multiple risk factors for sebaceous carcinoma.


In addition, patients should be educated on the clinical appearance of sebaceous neoplasms (yellow/orange/red raised lesions, may ulcerate or bleed, and often located on the face; ref. 52) to perform self-skin exams at home. Furthermore, to reduce risk for sebaceous carcinoma along with other skin cancer types, these high-risk populations (HIV positive individuals, individuals with Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome, and solid organ transplant recipients) should be advised about the importance of sun protection. HIV testing should also be considered for patients with newly diagnosed sebaceous carcinoma, particularly when diagnoses occur before age 50 and when there are other risk factors for HIV infection, such as intravenous drug use. Finally, if a virus is implicated in sebaceous carcinoma tumor development, then it may be possible to develop a vaccine to prevent infection and reduce cancer risk.


Conclusion


Recent studies have implicated UVR and immunosuppression in sebaceous carcinoma tumorigenesis. Further studies are necessary to understand the biology underlying these associations including whether a virus contributes to sebaceous gland neoplasia as well as the genetic alterations contributing to tumor development and metastasis in immunocompetent versus immunosuppressed populations. Because sebaceous carcinoma is a rare cancer, it will be necessary for institutions to share cases and data, which will allow for high-quality large-scale clinical and genomic studies. Moreover, these types of collaborations will centralize research efforts in a manner that will allow for translational studies, including clinical trials, to investigate novel therapies to treat this aggressive cutaneous malignancy.

AbstractDespite rare cancers accounting for 25% of adult tumors1, they are difficult to study due to the low disease incidence and geographically dispersed patient populations, which has resulted in significant unmet clinical needs for patients with rare cancers. We assessed whether a patient-partnered research approach using online engagement can overcome these challenges, focusing on angiosarcoma, a sarcoma with an annual incidence of 300 cases in the United States. Here we describe the development of the Angiosarcoma Project (ASCproject), an initiative enabling US and Canadian patients to remotely share their clinical information and biospecimens for research. The project generates and publicly releases clinically annotated genomic data on tumor and germline specimens on an ongoing basis. Over 18 months, 338 patients registered for the ASCproject, which comprises a large proportion of all patients with angiosarcoma. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 47 tumors revealed recurrently mutated genes that included KDR, TP53, and PIK3CA. PIK3CA-activating mutations were observed predominantly in primary breast angiosarcoma, which suggested a therapeutic rationale. Angiosarcoma of the head, neck, face and scalp (HNFS) was associated with a high tumor mutation burden (TMB) and a dominant ultraviolet damage mutational signature, which suggested that for the subset of patients with angiosarcoma of HNFS, ultraviolet damage may be a causative factor and that immune checkpoint inhibition may be beneficial. Medical record review revealed that two patients with HNFS angiosarcoma had received off-label therapeutic use of antibody to the programmed death-1 protein (anti-PD-1) and had experienced exceptional responses, which highlights immune checkpoint inhibition as a therapeutic avenue for HNFS angiosarcoma. This patient-partnered approach has catalyzed an opportunity to discover the etiology and potential therapies for patients with angiosarcoma. Collectively, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that empowering patients to directly participate in research can overcome barriers in rare diseases and can enable discoveries.

Data availability
To protect patient confidentiality, the study data set is de-identified before it is shared, which includes the masking of patient IDs and the reclassification of unique patient-reported demographic responses as ‚Äòother‚Äô (see Supplementary Methods). The resulting clinically annotated genomic data set of the ASCproject is shared publicly on cBioPortal on an ongoing and regular basis as the data are generated; the ASCproject has been registered as a study at dbGaP under the accession number phs001931 (contact data@ascproject.org with any questions regarding data availability).
Code availability
All software and pipelines for genomic data generation are described in detail in Supplementary Methods. Information on the scripts used to generate the figures is accessible upon request from the corresponding author.

This information was provided on the medical release forms completed by consented Angiosarcoma Project patients (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ225 patients). Of the 227 consented ASCproject participants, 2 people did not fill out the medical release form, and are not included in this figure. The majority of the 340 total institutions were listed by only one patient. Ten institutions were listed by five or more AS patients as sites of care (box, upper right). (b) A bar chart showing the patient responses to the intake survey question ‚ÄòPlease select all of the places in your body that you have ever had angiosarcoma (Please select all that apply).‚Äô Patient intake surveys completed by the 227 patients who consented for the Angiosarcoma Project as of September 30, 2018 were analyzed. Each response of a location is counted separately, such that multiple locations are shown for patients that selected more than one answer to indicate that they have had more than one location for their angiosarcoma lesions. 9 patients selected the provided response option of ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know‚Äô (‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Know‚Äô), and 7 patients did not respond to this question (‚ÄôNot Reported‚Äô). The HNFS category depicted above includes patient responses of ‚Äòhead, face, neck‚Äô and responses of ‚Äòscalp.‚Äô (c) Patient-reported information regarding other cancer diagnoses prior to angiosarcoma. Patient intake surveys completed by the 227 patients who consented for the Angiosarcoma Project as of September 30, 2018 were analyzed to obtain patient-reported information regarding other cancer diagnoses prior to angiosarcoma. Seventy five patients‚Äô responses indicated they had been diagnosed with another cancer prior to angiosarcoma. These patients were identified based on their responses of ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to the survey question ‚ÄúWere you ever diagnosed with any other kind of cancer(s)?‚Äù. Patients also provided specific diagnoses years for AS and other cancer(s), which were used to determine that the AS diagnosis occurred in the same year or after another cancer diagnosis. Of those 75 patients, 55 also responded ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to the survey question ‚ÄúHave you had radiation as a treatment for another cancer(s)?‚Äù. Of those 55 patients, 39 also reported ‚Äúbreast‚Äù as their only primary AS site and indicated breast cancer as a previous cancer. The majority of these 39 patients are expected to be cases of cutaneous AS of the breast. AS, angiosarcoma; ASCproject, The Angiosarcoma Project; HNFS, head, neck, face, scalp.Extended Data Fig. 5 Detailed diagram of each step of the Angiosarcoma Project.This diagram shows additional information regarding the attrition at various steps in the Angiosarcoma Project. Numbers indicated are as of September 30, 2018. 59 patients who signed the consent form did not provide a country of residence or indicated they were living outside of the U.S. or Canada. 2 patients did not sign the release form. 2 patients were not sent blood or saliva kits, including one patient who passed away before kits could be sent and another who provided an invalid mailing address. 43 patients did not return either their blood or saliva kits. 39 of 225 patients who signed the medical release form were in the study staff‚Äôs medical record request queue as of September 30, 2018. 200 of 419 requested medical records were not received (55 requests resulted in denials by medical record departments, and 145 requests did not get a response). 61 patients‚Äô records either did not contain sufficient information to request tissue or showed too little tissue to request for research. 21 requested FFPE samples have not yet been received. 5 received FFPE samples did not have available matched normal DNA (from blood or saliva) and were not initiated for sequencing. 28 submitted paired samples have not been sequenced (16 samples had insufficient material for sequencing and 12 sets of samples are still in the sequencing pipeline). 21 sequenced samples had less than 10% tumor purity. 2 samples were excluded from the dataset because centralized pathology review determined the samples were not angiosarcoma. The remaining 47 FFPE samples from 36 patients that underwent whole exome sequencing comprised the Angiosarcoma Project September 2018 dataset that was released on cBioPortal.org along with associated patient-reported and clinical data.Extended Data Fig. 6 Patient-reported data from the 36 AS patients whose samples were sequenced in the Angiosarcoma Project.The intake survey completed during the ASCproject registration process by these 36 patients were analyzed. (a) A bar chart showing the age in years of these 36 patients at initial diagnosis with AS (mean: 47.8 years). These values were calculated from patient provided date of birth and date of initial AS diagnosis. (b) A bar chart showing the years elapsed between these 36 patients‚Äô initial diagnosis with AS and patients‚Äô registration in the ASCproject (mean: 4.6 years). These values were calculated from the date of project registration and the patient-provided date of initial AS diagnosis. (c) A bar chart showing the patient-reported location of angiosarcoma at the time of last intake survey completion. An option was provided for patients to report no evidence of disease. Patients with more than one location of AS were able to provide more than one site. 2 patients did not respond to this question (‚ÄòNot Reported‚Äô) and 1 patient responded ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Know.‚Äô AS, Angiosarcoma; ASCproject, The Angiosarcoma Project.Extended Data Fig. 7 Recurring alterations and dominant mutational signatures in angiosarcoma.(a) Co-mutation plot shows significantly recurring mutated genes among (N=36 patients) AS patients. TP53 and KDR are significantly mutated across the cohort. The p-values were computed using fisher‚Äôs method and truncated product method. FDR (q values) were generated using Benjamini and Hochber method to correct for multiple hypotheses. Genes that have the ‚Äìlog 10 q value >=1 (red line) are significant. Box plot of the allelic fractions of the mutations in individual tumors is shown below the mutation plot. The horizontal red line represents median and the whiskers to extend to the data extremes. (b) Stick plot of KDR showing the recurrent mutations and their positions that were identified in this AS cohort. (c) Bar graph representing the number of tumor samples (y-axis) that are grouped based on 5 dominant mutational signature categories (x-axis). (d) Box plot representing the distribution of TMB (y-axis) for N=47 tumor samples across five mutational signature processes (as defined by COSMIC) identified in this cohort and categorized among 8 AS subclassifications (x-axis). Samples with dominant signature 7 (yellow, N=10 tumor samples) which corresponds to UV light exposure, have the highest median TMB and this signature was only observed in HNFS AS. Horizontal bars indicate median values, while the boxes show the IQR. The whiskers extend to 1.5√ó the IQR on either side.

PIK3CA hotspot mutations were defined (depmap.org) using their frequency of occurrence in TCGA and COSMIC databases. Relative to cell lines with wild-type PIK3CA, PIK3CA-mutant cell lines are significantly more sensitive to CRISPR knockout-induced loss of PIK3CA (PIK3CA hotspot mutant (n=64 cell lines, median=-0.669, minimum=-1.16, maximum=-0.147) vs PIK3CA WT (n=479 cell lines, median=-0.298, minimum=-0.961, maximum=0.135), p-value = 1.46 x 10-14, mean difference = -0.328, 95% CI: (-0.396,-0.260)); cell lines with PIK3CA with AS mutations (n=6 cell lines, median=-0.511, minimum=-0.740, maximum=-0.344) vs PIK3CA WT (n=479 cell lines, median=-0.298, minimum=-0.961, maximum=0.135), (p-value = 4.40 x 10-2, mean difference = -0.181, 95% CI: (-0.355,-0.007)). Statistical comparisons were performed using a two-sample, two-sided unpaired t-test. WT, wild-type; AS, angiosarcoma.Extended Data Fig. 9 Radiation therapy received for angiosarcoma by the sequenced patient cohort.A pie chart showing information regarding radiation treatments received by the 36 sequenced patients in the cohort. This information was abstracted from obtained medical records. These radiation therapies may have been given in conjunction with pharmacological and/or surgical interventions. Patients were categorized into groups depicted in pie chart: patients who received neoadjuvant radiation (2 patients), patients who received adjuvant radiation (12 patients), patients who received radiation for AS without surgery (2), and patients who did not receive radiation for AS (19). For one patient who was categorized as ‚ÄòUnknown‚Äô, the medical records were not sufficient to abstract this information.

Abstract
Breast sebaceous carcinoma is one of the rarest breast neoplasms, with less than 30 cases reported worldwide. Due to the rarity, the new WHO classification of breast tumors grouped these tumors among the ductal carcinoma. A detailed description of these cases is relevant due to the insufficient knowledge about the prognosis of this neoplasm. We report the clinical, histological, and immunohistochemical characteristics of a case of sebaceous carcinoma of the breast in an 81-year-old woman with a right breast nodule. The tumor was composed of nests of a varying mixture of sebaceous cells with abundant slightly vacuolated cytoplasm, surrounded by smaller oval-to-fusiform cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm without vacuolization. No lymph node metastases were present. The immunohistochemical reactions were positive for GATA3, EMA, CD15, and GCDFP15 (focal staining), and negative for RE, RP, and HER-2. The tumor was classified as triple-negative. Morphologically, the differential diagnoses included skin sebaceous carcinoma, lipid-rich carcinoma, apocrine carcinoma, and glycogen-rich clear cell carcinoma. Most of the previously reported cases were positive for RE and RP, which generally was associated with a better prognosis. However, some cases presented a more aggressive behavior with distant and lymph node metastases.

However, periocular SC originated from the eyebrow is rare, which may cause poorer outcomes due to a greater likelihood of orbital invasion and excessive tumor volume. In the present case, we exhibited a 68-year-old male presenting with a large solid mass in his right eyebrow region developing in ten months. Based on the patient‚Äôs history, clinical conditions, orbital computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan results, a malignant tumor was suspected preliminarily. Excisional biopsy was performed, and the histopathologic examination and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of the tumor revealed SC. The patient declined the enlarged surgery recommended next and ended up with death caused by the distant metastasis of SC. The case highlighted the fact that despite its rarity, SC should be considered as a differential diagnosis of tumors located in the eyebrow region and histopathologic evaluation must be performed to reach a definite diagnosis.

Introduction
Sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is an uncommon but aggressive malignancy that develops from cells comprising sebaceous glands.1‚Äì3 The clinical manifestations of eyelid SC are non-specific with the lesions¬†having wide morphologic diversity and involving different periorbital parts, and can lead to an initial misdiagnosis in up to 50% of patients.4 Besides, the overall incidence of SC is increasing significantly in recent years.5 Therefore, ophthalmologists are urged to improve their knowledge and awareness of SC to increase¬†the¬†rate of early diagnosis and reduce misdiagnosis.
SC typically arises from meibomian glands of the eyelids, with the upper eyelid predominant due to the higher distribution of glands.1‚Äì3 Zeis glands of the eyelid (about 10%) and the lacrimal caruncle (<10%) are also periocular sites of SC.1,2 However, SC primarily originated from the eyebrow is rare, and to our knowledge there is little mention in the ophthalmic literature about SC of the eyebrow.1,2 In a retrospective study carried by Beijing Tongren Hospital in China, only one case was found arising from the eyebrow region among 354 eyelid SC patients.6 Herein, we reported a rare case of SC occurred in the eyebrow region which caused a fatal prognosis.
Case Report
A 68-year-old male was referred to our ophthalmology department for a large solid mass in his right eyebrow region. The mass developed in the past 10 months, causing compression to the eyeball as well as adjacent tissues gradually. The patient reported symptoms including restricted ocular motility and occasional stinging eyes. He had a 10-year¬†history of¬†hypertension and suffered a stroke 2 years ago which leaving with the sequelae of slurred speech. There was a mentionable history of orbital trauma that he hurt his right eyebrow at 10-years-old. He was previously diagnosed with a bilateral cataract and bilateral pterygium and denied any history of ocular surgery.
On ocular examination, an irregular and solid mass lesion measuring 40√ó20√ó15mm visually was observed spanning across the right eyebrow region with the main body located on the nasal side, causing ptosis¬†of the upper eyelid and limitation of eye movements. The lesion had poor mobility and a lobulated appearance with¬†a¬†small depression and hyperpigmented area¬†in the surface (Figure 1). Visual acuity of the patient was 20/100 in the right eye and 20/125 in the left eye, and both intraocular pressure and exophthalmos measurement were normal. Slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination revealed bilateral lens opacities (nuclear 3+/4+) and abnormal fibrovascular tissue of the conjunctiva encroaching onto the cornea. The remaining ophthalmic examination was unremarkable. Initial imaging of the orbit (computed tomography [CT] followed by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) revealed an irregular space-occupying lesion with a rich blood supply growing within soft tissue above the right orbit to the forehead which was considered to be a neoplastic lesion (Figure 2A-F). Based on the patient‚Äôs history, clinical conditions, CT and MRI scan results, a malignant tumor was suspected preliminarily.

Figure 1 Clinical photo showed an irregular and lobulated mass lesion spanning across the right eyebrow region with a small depression and hyperpigmented area in the surface (white arrow).


Figure 2 (A) CT axial image revealed an ill-defined and irregular soft tissue density shadow spanning across the eyebrow region (white arrow). The CT value was 40HU.The shape and size of the eyeballs, extraocular muscles and optic nerve on both sides were normal and symmetrical. No abnormality was observed in the orbital bone. (B) Sagittal reconstruction from the CT scan image showed the lesion locating above the right orbit to the forehead (white arrow). The lesion exhibited on MRI as an inhomogenous hypointense (white arrow) on¬†T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) (C) and hyperintense (white arrow) on¬†T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) (D) with unclear boundary. (E and F) Axial and sagittal contrast-enhanced¬†T1WI showed a heterogeneous enhancement (white arrows).

The patient underwent an excisional biopsy required for definite diagnosis in our hospital and resection was performed with a 4-mm surgical margin. The excised lesion consisted of a main part of 28√ó18√ó7mm in size and the other part of 10√ó8√ó8mm, and was suspicious for malignant cutaneous neoplasm originated from adnexal structures¬†of¬†the¬†skin. The lesion was tumor-positive at partial resection margins assessed with intraoperative frozen pathological examination. The postoperative¬†pathological¬†report indicated the diagnosis of poorly-differentiated SC and demonstrated the neoplasm partially sarcomatoid differentiation and with focal basal cell carcinoma (BCC) component (Figure 3A‚ÄìC). Immunohistochemistry (IHC)¬†staining¬†(EnVision method) and special staining of Alcian blue/Periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) were performed subsequently to ensure the¬†diagnosis. IHC¬†stains were positive for cytokeratin (CK), P63, CK5/6, androgen receptor (AR), with a high Ki-67 expression (35%‚Äì40%); and negative for CK7, CK20, S-100, HMB45, MelanA, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), SMA, Calponin, CD34, PR, CEA, CgA and Syn (Figure 3D and E). Besides, the lesion was detected to have small foci of positivity dispersedly on PAS stain but negativity on AB stain.

Figure 3 Postoperative histopathological examination of resected lesion showed diffuse infiltrative growth of the mass with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain at 200√ó magnification. (A) In the typical zone of the lesion, a large number of nest-like heterotypic cells were seen within¬†the fibrous stroma of dermis. Some cells contained large, oval or round nuclei and vacuolated clear¬†cytoplasm (black arrows), and some had vesicular nuclei with small¬†nucleoli could be observed and nuclear¬†division easily visualized (black circle). (B) Spindle¬†sarcoma-like cells were visualized in part of the sarcomatous zone of the lesion (black arrows) which had a transition between the nest-like component zone (black circles). (C) In the BCC zone of the lesion, some tumor cells in the superficial dermis were found to be small nest-like (black arrows), and some basal cells arranged in a palisading pattern like BCC. IHC staining (EnVision¬†Method) was performed on the neoplasm and revealed CK5/6 strongly positive at 100√ó magnification (D) and AR focally positive (black arrows) at 200√ó magnification (E).

Regional lymph node examination, chest X-ray, abdomen B-ultrasound and blood tumor marker test¬†were performed subsequently on the patient and no evidence of¬†nodal metastasis¬†or distant metastasis was found. Considering the large size of the tumor and its invasion of the periorbital tissue, we suggested the patient undergo enlarged resection and if necessary removal of orbital contents. However, the patient was unable to accept this proposal and chose to transfer to another hospital for further treatment. Unfortunately, we reached the patient‚Äôs family and learned that the patient had died due to the distant metastasis of SC 3 years later, though second surgery and multiple radiotherapy had been performed.
Discussion
SC is a rare cutaneous malignant neoplasm which accounting for less than 5.5% of all eyelid malignancies in Whites but much higher proportion in Asians (even over 30%).3,7,8 The published literature reported that about 75% SCs occur in the periocular region while the remaining 25% appear in extraocular areas.1,2 However, periocular SCs rarely originate from glands of the eyebrows, which causing it difficult to take SC into consideration promptly when the tumor occurred in the eyebrow region.3,9
As the clinical presentation of SC has no specific features and commonly masquerades as a variety of conditions both inflammatory and neoplastic, it frequently causes misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis which resulting in inappropriate treatments and increasing mortality.1,9 Thus, ophthalmologists should be familiar with the differential diagnosis of SC which aiding in making the timely diagnosis. Given the fact that the majority of SCs present with upper eyelid involvement, its differential diagnosis usually includes atypical or recurrent chalazion, thickening of the eyelids (nodular or diffuse), non-treatment responsive blepharoconjunctivitis and persistent or unilateral blepharitis.1,2 However, when SC rarely occurs in the eyebrow region, being in the form of subcutaneous nodules usually, mainly other periorbital masses appearing in the same region are considered as the differential diagnosis, such as pyogenic granuloma, epidermoid cyst, etc. Malignant tumors like BCC, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and malignant melanoma can be masqueraded by SC and should be taken into consideration as well.
SC has characteristic imaging findings, so imaging examinations like orbital CT and MRI should be routinely performed when the tumor is suspected to be malignant to aid in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of SC. MRI is the preferred imaging examination for SC which has a much higher resolution in soft tissue imaging than CT and can avoid the radiation damage of the lens and cornea.10,11 MRI¬†typically exhibits eyelid SCs as nodular, ‚Äúcauliflower-like‚Äù, ring-shaped or irregularly soft tissue mass shadows of the eyelid. The lesions are hypointense on T1WI and hyperintense on T2WI, and unevenly enhanced in the enhanced¬†MRI¬†scan. On CT, lesions usually present as soft tissue density masses in the shape of ring strip and nodule with unclear boundaries. The density is either homogenous, or heterogeneous with gas sign, patchy¬†high-density¬†shadow caused by hemorrhage or¬†low-density shadow due to liquefaction¬†necrosis.
The definitive diagnosis of SC is established by histopathological examinations with IHC and special staining occasionally serving as ancillary tools to confirm the diagnosis and differentiate SC from other malignant tumors like BCC, SCC and malignant melanoma.12 Immunostaining for AR, EMA, Ber-EP4 and adipophilin (ADP) have been used as reliable markers of sebaceous differentiation and to differentiate SC from BCC and SCC.13,14 Generally, SCs were EMA+, ADP+, Ber-EP4‚Äì and AR+, SCCs were EMA+, ADP‚Äì/+, Ber-EP4‚Äì/+ and AR‚Äì, whereas BCCs were EMA‚Äì, ADP‚Äì, Ber-EP4+ and AR‚Äì/+.13‚Äì16 EMA is expressed primarily in both the cytoplasm and membrane of the sebocytes, while in SC the positive expression of EMA refers to the cytoplasmic positive rather than membranous positive, and corresponds to the vacuolated cytoplasm morphologically. Hence, in the present case the negative expression of EMA may resulted from the poor differentiation of tumor with tumor cells lacking the¬†typical vacuolate-like morphology. Unfortunately, Ber-EP4 and ADP antibodies were not used in our case. The anti-cytokeratin antibodies are used in IHC detection of SC as well, however, the sensitivity and specificity of them are lower than those of other antibodies and the positive expressions of them are significant while the negative findings are not so valuable in diagnosing.17 CK5/6 and p63 are regarded as traditional immunochemical markers for the diagnosis of SCC and squamous differentiation, while they had been found to be positive in some SCs,12,18,19 for instance, Soares et al19 reported that 10 cases of SC originating from major salivary glands were positive for CK5, and half of them were also positive for p63 which were predominantly expressed in the immature sebocytes as well as in poorly-differentiated cells. CK5/6 and p63 were also positive in the poorly-differentiated SC in our case, which were consistent with Soares‚Äôs findings.19 CK7 showed positive reactions in approximately half cases of SC,17,20 yet was negative in the present case. Special staining of Oil Red O and Sudan IV are classical methods¬†to confirm the presence of lipid in cytoplasmic vacuoles¬†and can form the primary basis for a diagnosis of SC whose tumor¬†cells¬†usually had lipid-rich¬†cytoplasm.2, 18 However, fresh excised samples in many cases were not kept to be stained with Oil Red O or Sudan IV in the intraoperative frozen pathological examination and similar condition arose in our case.14,18 We then used AB-PAS staining which can highlight and distinguish¬†neutral mucins from¬†acid¬†mucins in the postoperative sections and the results showed the cytoplasmic vacuoles containing little glycogen. To our knowledge, AB-PAS staining was seldomly used in the diagnosis of SC, and PAS was found to be positive in partial area in a SC of submandibular gland while negative in another case of right palate.18,21
Surgical excision is the mainstream treatment for SC, while chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be employed as adjunctive therapies for metastatic and recurrent SC. According to the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/tumor‚Äênode‚Äêmetastasis (TNM) staging system, the tumor in the present case was evaluated to be in T3N0M0 category and a surgical approach of extended resection plus orbital exenteration was immediately suggested.22 It has been revealed that clinicopathologic risk factors associated with poorer outcomes in SC included simultaneous involvement of both upper and lower eyelids, orbital invasion, pagetoid infiltration, large tumor size and tumor duration of 6 months or greater.23 The tumor in our case met the conditions pointing toward a dismal prognosis with the location of the superficial orbit and a duration over 6 months. The patient¬†was not psychologically¬†ready¬†to accept the extended resection at that time. In fact, although he underwent the second surgery at another hospital after a while, the long delay¬†in¬†the¬†treatment aggravated¬†his¬†condition rapidly and led to a fatal prognosis at final. This reminded us that properly¬†and adequate communication regarding the condition of patients¬†especially those with¬†malignancy¬†is an extremely important skill for clinicians. Clinicians should have a knowledge of the patients‚Äô uncertainty and concerns of the condition, and try to persuade them to accept the treatments which are beneficial to improve the condition in a way that is understandable to them.
Conclusion
In summary, it is noteworthy that despite its rarity SC should be considered as a differential diagnosis of tumors located in the eyebrow region, and it may lead to poorer outcomes because of a great likelihood of orbital invasion and excessive tumor size. Histopathologic evaluation must be carried out to reach the definite diagnosis and treatments are supposed to be performed appropriately and timely by properly and adequate doctor-patient communication.

Abstract:
  Simple SummaryMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an uncommon type of skin cancer that carries a poor prognosis. It is seen predominantly in old age in sun-exposed body parts. Racial and geographical differences are seen in its occurrence. Viral infection and radiation exposure are the two leading factors implicated in its causation. Small, firm to hard nodule (usually in sun-exposed areas), red with a history of a rapid increase in size is a common personation of the disease. Other body parts such as upper limbs, trunk, and even lower limbs may be also involved. The disease is diagnosed by taking a tissue sample (biopsy) for examination, and other radiological investigations are needed to reach a proper diagnosis with the staging of the disease. There are various treatment options including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Surgery is the primary treatment option though some patients may not be the candidates for operation where other treatment options come into play.  AbstractMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an infrequent, rapidly growing skin neoplasm that carries a greater probability of regional lymph node involvement, and a grim prognosis in advanced cases. While it is seen predominantly in old age in sun-exposed body parts, the prevalence varies among different races and geographical regions. Merkel cell polyomavirus and UV radiation-induced mutations contribute to its etiopathogenesis. The clinical presentation of MCC lacks pathognomonic features and is rarely considered highly at the time of presentation. Histopathological examination frequently reveals hyperchromatic nuclei with high mitotic activity, but immunohistochemistry is required to confirm the diagnosis. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and imaging are advised for effective staging of the disease. Multimodal management including surgery, radiation therapy, and/or immunotherapy are deployed. Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies may result in an initial response, but do not result in a significant survival benefit. Checkpoint inhibitors have dramatically improved the prognosis of patients with metastatic MCC, and are recommended first-line in advanced cases. There is a need for well-tolerated agents with good safety profiles in patients who have failed immunotherapies.

  1. IntroductionMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an infrequent, rapidly growing skin neoplasm initially described by Cyril Toker in the year 1972. The ‚Äúcell of origin‚Äù of MCC is yet to be fully substantiated. Based on the similarities in biology and morphology of the ‚ÄòMerkel cells‚Äô (MC), which are epidermal cells with both epithelial and neuroendocrine attributes and MCC, it has been postulated to arise from the MCs and is thus occasionally described as neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. Epidermal stem cells, dermal fibroblasts, B cell precursors, and neuronal precursor cells have all been proposed as possible cells of origin for MCC [8]. Though MCC can involve any anatomical part/region in the human body, it occurs predominantly in the solar unshielded body parts in older males, with numerous studies substantiating the effects of long-term ultra-violet radiation exposure [3,4]. Most importantly, MCC is strongly associated with immunosuppression, both iatrogenic and age-related [4,5,6,9,10,11,12,13,14]. It is frequently associated with regional lymphadenopathy and disseminated disease can spread to many parts of the body. The high mortality rate renders it twice as deadly as melanoma [3,4,15].  2. EpidemiologyThe etiopathogenesis of MCC involves an intricate mutual interaction among various intrinsic and extrinsic factors and influences. Although the specific cause is yet to be determined, two aetiologies that have been widely discussed and postulated include viral oncogenesis and radiation [3,6,9,15]. The identification of MC polyomavirus (MCPyV) in most tumor specimens by Feng et al. proved to be a landmark study in our understanding of its biology. Furthermore, a study by Touz√© A et al. in 2009 confirmed this association of MCPyV with MCC [16,17]. While the precise mechanisms by which MCPyV promotes tumorigenesis are debatable, the expression of MCPyV early region genes plays a critical role in oncogenesis. UV radiation appears to synergize with MCPyV to promote tumorigenesis, and it has been suggested that mutations to the viral genome promote viral integration and tumorigenesis [5]. Notably, psoriasis patients on phototherapy treatment are 100 times more predisposed to develop MCC, and correlations between MCC and radiation index and decreased skin pigmentation have been noted [15,16]. Accordingly, the predominant, but not exclusive, sites of involvement are exposed parts including the head and uncovered areas of the upper limbs (Figure 1) [17,18,19]. A compromised immune system is also a well-established risk factor for MCC; iatrogenic immune suppression, lymphoproliferative disorders such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, autoimmune disorders, organ transplant candidates, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are known to increase the likelihood of MCC [18,19,20]. The high prevalence of MCC in older patients suggests that immunosenescence may contribute as well [5,6].MCC occurs less frequently than melanoma, squamous, or basal cell cancers [16]. Although the incidence appears to be increasing in the previous few decades, the rarity of the tumor hinders the assessment of the true incidence. Improved diagnostic techniques, a growing elderly population, and an increase in the number of immune-compromised patients may all be contributing to the rise in incidence [2,21]. Incidence rates vary across different parts of the world. As is true for other UV radiation-induced cutaneous malignancies, Australia tops the list with the incidence of 16 cases per million population [15]. Notably, the incidence of MC Polyoma virus-positive cases is low in Australia [11]. The age-adjusted annual incidence from the United States, Europe, and Australasia lies between 0.1 and 1.6 per 100,000, with the number of cases reported from Asia the lowest [3,15]. In the United States, about 1600 new cases are detected every year [5,6,9].The frequency of MCC differs among varied ethnic clusters and regional zones-prevalence being 25 times higher in the white population than dark skin types. The classic patient is an elderly white man aged above 70 years with a history of prolonged sun exposure [15,22]. The age-adjusted incidence rate is 8 times lower in the black populace [5,9,15]. Most studies confirm that males outnumber females; with some demonstrating a gender ratio of up to 2:1. However, though some small studies have demonstrated either not predilection or a slight female preponderance [17,22]. Females tend to be older than males at presentation (76 years vs. 71 years) [13]. The lesions are mostly encountered in the head with the trunk the favored location in younger patients and lower limbs in African Americans [5].Following past studies, the mean age at diagnosis in most recent studies is reported to be 74.9 years. It is extremely rare in children and young people, being 24 times more common after 65 years of age and only 5% diagnosed before 50 years. Two studies (one from New Zealand and another US-based) demonstrated an enhancement in the age-specific incidence in old age group patients when compared with a younger group [6,22].  3. Clinical PresentationThe clinical manifestations of MCC are protean and are rarely suspected at the time of presentation [5,15,16]. One common presentation is a single, firm to hard, rounded, red to violaceous nodule or tumors that are non-tender and rapidly growing [22,23]. (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3).The tumors are observed more commonly on the left side than on the right. Such an observation has not revealed any correlation with the radiation exposure, age, sex, site predilection, or MCPyV status [24]. The explanation for such laterality of the lesions continues to remain indeterminate. Gambichler T et al. reported the left-sided predominance of the tumors in the ratio of 8:I (torso), 1.8:1 (head and lower limbs) and 1.2:1 (upper limbs), et [24] Lesion tends to grow as hemispheres towards the outside (giving typical dome shape) or in an iceberg fashion to inside [10]. Rapid growth with ulceration can be observed.Multiple morphologic features including papules, plaques, cysts, pruritic growths, stalked neoplasms, deep cutaneous masses, and lesions with telangiectasia, have all have been reported in the literature [15,16]. The majority (70‚Äì90%) of these lesions have an affinity for the head/neck or upper extremities (Figure 1). Head and neck lesions are typically smaller than those from other regions [16]. Additional diagnoses in the differential may include basal/squamous cell carcinoma (BCC/SCC), lymphoma cutis, pyogenic granuloma, sarcoma, epidermal inclusion cyst, dermatofibroma, adipose tumor, melanoma (amelanotic type), or metastatic lesions, and should be differentiated from them through biopsy [16,23]. Carneiro et al. reported concomitant malignancy in 18.7% of patients in the form of BCC, SCC, and sebaceous carcinoma [9]. Heath et al. have devised an initialism (AEIOU) to elucidate the typical manifestations of MCC: asymptomatic, rapid expansion, immune suppression, old age (>50), and ultraviolet radiation exposure. In his study, ‚â•3 of these traits were found in about 89% of the patients [14,15]. Mucosal MCC‚Äôs (e.g., oral/genital), although rare, have been reported to be more aggressive than the cutaneous ones [15,16]. At presentation, localized cutaneous disease is documented in about two-thirds of patients; however, cases with the nodal disease at presentation are not infrequent. The US National Cancer Database reveals two-thirds of patients presenting with localized tumor followed by draining lymph node basin adenopathy in 27%, while 7% exhibit metastasis to remote areas. In contrast, the SEER Program reported local disease in <50% cases with the same percentage of metastasis. In 14% of patients, despite the documented metastasis, the primary tumor cannot be identified [13,18]. It is to be emphasized that ‚Äò‚Äòvisceral MCC‚Äô‚Äô without any skin manifestation is currently regarded as a distinct subtype of neuroendocrine carcinoma [5,13,15]. This should be distinguished from nodal only MCC, which is thought to be MCC with spontaneous resolution of the cutaneous lesion. Importantly, MCC in situ is extremely rare. Basically, these are dermal tumors, as already described, with the involvement of epidermis alone extremely unusual; only a very few cases of such stage 0 disease are reported in the literature [25].  4. EtiopathogenesisThe pathogenesis of MCC is partially known. In addition, the cell of genesis for MCC also remains unclear and is currently debated [6,10]. Merkel cells, named as ‚Äò‚Äòtouch cells,‚Äô‚Äô when originally reported by Frederich Merkel long back in 1876, are seen mainly in the basal layer of the epidermis. They are physiologically implicated in tactile response and somatostatin production and have a presumed role in other endocrine functions. This explains the historical designation of ‚Äò‚Äòneuroendocrine‚Äô‚Äô for MCC tumors [5,6,9,10]. While MCC‚Äôs are broadly classified into 3 histological subtypes‚Äîtrabecular, intermediate, and small cell‚Äîthere is not yet any substantiation for the clinical utility of such classifications [2,3]. The trabecular type (least common) is well-differentiated and is commonly observed in mixed tumors. The intermediate type is most common (observed in ‚â•50% of tumors) with high mitotic activity. The small-cell type is poorly/undifferentiated and appears similar to small cell carcinoma of other locations, especially the lung [22,23]. Pathologically, MCC is typically located in the dermis and occasionally in the sub-dermis with sparing of the epidermis in general [25]. At times, the monotonous appearance of the ‚Äúsmall round cells‚Äù in the dermal layer and subdermal adipose tissue, makes MCC indistinguishable from malignant lymphomas with immunohistochemical stains [26,27]. A range of trabecular, insular, or diffuse growth patterns may be seen, with either one or all patterns coexisting within an individual tumor. The dermis is often filled, with a very narrow area of uninvolved papillary dermis set apart from the epidermis by a slender zone called the ‚ÄòGrenz zone‚Äô. The cytoplasm can be visualized as a thin acidophilic rim and is amphophilic to eosinophilic. The following are some histopathologic pictures of MCC (Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6).The nuclei are relatively uniform and grayish being round and vesicular, having a typical fine granular ‚Äúpepper and salt‚Äù appearing chromatin motif and multiple nucleoli; hyperchromatic nuclei and high mitotic activity are characteristic [4]. Mitotic figures are abundant and fragmented nuclei are plentiful. Necrosis may be present, occasionally associated with hematoxylin staining of vessel walls and fibrous septa known as the ‚ÄúAzzopardi phenomenon‚Äù [28]. These histological features need to be distinguished from other so-called ‚Äòsmall round cell tumor‚Äô groups as well as from melanoma. Accurate diagnostic discrimination of these entities is critically important for predicting long-term prognosis determining the appropriate treatment. As no histologic features can reliably distinguish MCC from other small round cell tumors, immunohistochemical stains prove useful in excluding these differentials [19]. Immunohistochemically, MCC shows positivity for low molecular weight keratin and neurofilaments, which appear as dot-like condensations of filaments. In particular, it is strongly positive for keratin type 20 with distinct dots concentrated around the nucleus [9,29,30]. CK20 and neurofilament positivity and Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) negativity are important to designate MCC from histologically similar neoplasms. CK20 staining in MCC is often dot-like but a decoration of the cytoskeleton is also possible [31,32,33]. In rare cases, MCC may stain for CK7, while being negative for CK20 [34]; CK19 has its diagnostic significance for CK20-negative MCC [35]. Consequently, tumors that are positive for CK20 along with TTF-1 negativity indicate MCC [22,23]. Immunohistochemical demonstration of neuron-specific enolase, intense staining for keratin (CK20), and absence of S100 protein, leukocyte common antigen, vimentin, and HMB45 are enough to confirm the diagnosis [35,36] (Table 1). In addition to the above-mentioned markers, cases of MCC manifest reactivity with chromogranin, synaptophysin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P, pancreatic polypeptide, calcitonin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, somatostatin, other peptide hormones, PAX-5, TdT, glypican-3, and CD117 [37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44].  5. Diagnostic Evaluation/StagingDiagnostic evaluation starts with proper history and clinical examination. Quite atypical and diverse gross manifestations constitute diagnostic challenges even for experienced clinicians. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is advocated in most cases for definitive disease staging since 33% of the patients with clinical evidence of primary disease harbor occult disease in draining lymph node basin [15,18].The guidelines from the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for diagnostic evaluation include: differentiation from nodal only MCC, which is thought to be MCC with spontaneous resolution of the cutaneous lesion, imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), or positron emission tomography (PET) can be performed as clinically indicated; and when possible, individual cases ought to be discussed in a multi-facility tumor board of the institution [14,16,22]. According to the updated American Joint Committee on Cancer (AGCC) staging system for MCC (Table 2), according to life expectancy, patients are categorized into different groups. This staging system blends clinical and pathological elements of the disease to facilitate appropriate treatment strategies. Additionally, it regrouped pathologically confirmed nodal disease with unconfirmed primary lesion into stage IIIA, highlighting the improved clinical outcomes connected to it [13,14,15].  6. Prognostic Factors and Disease ProgressionUsually, MCC does not have a good prognosis, especially when the initial presentation is that of metastatic disease. Despite substantial insights into the tumor biology of MCC, survival rates continue to be poor for advanced disease. Until the advent of checkpoint inhibitor treatment, the main therapeutic option for advanced MCC has been chemotherapy, where there have been seen initially good responses though without any significant survival benefit. With the advent of checkpoint inhibitors, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are refined dramatically in advanced disease. A single-arm trial with Pembrolizumab/Avelumab leads to the approval of the use of checkpoint inhibitors by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of advanced MCC [45,46]. The estimated overall five-year survival for local disease is 51% whereas it stands at 14% for metastatic disease. A study from the Netherlands reported 1-, 5-, and 10-year relative survival of 85%, 62%, and 47%, respectively [47]. However, the 5-year survival rate in a study by Agelli and Clegg was reported to be 75%, 59%, and 25% for local, regional, and distant disease, respectively [7]. A study by Tam et al. revealed that females have a survival advantage over men [48]. Disease-associated mortality is rated at 33‚Äì46%, which markedly surpasses that seen in melanoma patients, assigning it as the second leading cause of skin cancer death [15,22]. Recurrence is usually encountered during the initial 2 years of disease. Frohm et al. observed a mean of 10.7 months for the first recurrence to appear with a range of 3.5 to 23.3 months [49]. MCV positivity is known to predict favorable outcomes when compared to similar tumors that are MCPyV negative [4,15,19]. A subset of MCPyV-positive patients produce MCPyV-specific antibodies, which also serve as a favorable prognostic factor. The presence of antibodies against an MCPyV T antigen, but not capsid protein antibodies, predicts recurrent or progressive disease if observed 1-year post tumor excision [50]. Furthermore, CD8 T cell counts in the neoplasm are considered to predict survival; a study by Feldmeyer et al. proposed tumoral immune infiltrates as a strong prognostic indicator [51]. Finally, some histologic and immunohistochemical features have been reported to predict disease progression. Specifically, rapid mitosis, small cell morphology, the paucity of inflammatory infiltrates, lymphovascular involvement, p53 positivity, p63 positivity, raised mast cell-cell counts, and dense tumoral/peritumoral vascularity all have been proposed to be negative predictors, with p63 exhibiting the greatest prognostic value [52,53,54,55,56,57]. The strongest negative prognostic indicators include male gender, advanced age, comorbid conditions, immunocompromised state, head and neck localization, tumor of 2 cm or more, advanced stage (clinically presence of lymph nodes, distant metastases), and positive resection margins [5,9]. It is worth noting that the time interval between the presentation and initiation of treatment is crucial to prognosticate the disease progression [4]. The prognostic utility of tumor thickness continues to be controversial. While some authors indicated that a nodal disease with a poor prognosis is related to tumor thickness, others have refuted it [9].Nodal MCC without any evidence of a primary tumor is associated with improved survival, perhaps due to an active immune-mediated clearance of the cutaneous tumor before its presentation. A potential immunological clearance of the carcinoma is seconded by several reports of spontaneous regression of the tumor including distant metastatic ones [15,16]. Advancement to metastatic disease is classically noticed within the first 3 years of diagnosis. Distant metastasis has most commonly been observed in the liver, lung, brain, bones, and remote skin. Less frequent sites of advanced disease include gastrointestinal epithelia, pancreas, parotid gland, pleura, cardiac tissue, bone marrow, prostate, testicles, and urinary bladder [13,16,18].  7. Treatment OptionsDepending upon the clinical stage, comorbidities, and performance status of the patient, multimodality management protocols consisting of extirpation of the primary lesion, regional lymphadenectomy with radiotherapy/chemotherapy is being employed as the optimal treatment. However, at present, there is debate on the most efficacious treatment scheme for the advanced disease; moreover, it should be distinguished from nodal only MCC, which is thought to be MCC with spontaneous resolution of the cutaneous lesion [9,10,11].Operative management is the gold standard for localized or locoregional disease. Wide excision with a margin of 1‚Äì2 cm (1 cm for <2 cm tumor size and 2 cm for >2 cm ones) is usually recommended [15,20]. Surgery resulting in positive margins is a candidate for re-excision. In sites where tissue sparing is critical, Mohs microsurgery may be an option, but lack of unanimity precludes its utility. Lymph node dissection followed by radiation is the standard treatment for Stage III disease. SLNB is typically recommended at the time of the primary surgery for the cases without nodes on clinical examination. For those with positive SLNB, elective lymph node dissection (ELND) with radiation is the norm [13,20].Radiotherapy (RT) is utilized both as an adjuvant to surgery and as a monotherapy in those in whom surgery is not conducive or suitable, e.g., an elderly patient with a plethora of comorbidities with high risk for anesthesia/surgery. Most frequently, it is employed for the locoregional control of the disease. Most literature suggests that recurrence rates are considerably reduced with adjuvant RT, which has better results than adjuvant chemotherapy [58,59,60,61]. The cumulative radiation dosage regimen for the primary site ranges between 50 and 56 Gy for margin negative surgery with dosage enhancement up to 60 Gy for positive histological margins and a maximum of 66 Gy for gross disease (standard fractions ranging from 1.8 to 2 Gy per session) (Table 3) [58].Cook et al. stated that postoperative single-fraction radiotherapy is a promising option to conventionally fractionated postoperative radiotherapy to treat the primary lesion in localized head/neck Merkel cell tumors, particularly in elderly and frail patients (not candidates for surgery), with potential control of disease without noticeable toxicity [62]. A retrospective study in the Moffitt Cancer Center revealed that postsurgical radiation improves disease control as well as disease-specific survival in cases having positive nodal disease, but without any effect in patients with no nodal involvement. The international guidelines recommend that adjuvant radiation should be initiated within 4‚Äì6 weeks of surgery for all stages of the disease (I‚ÄìIII). (NCCN 2021) [63]. In general, for large node-negative tumors, consensus panels and international guidelines agree that adjuvant RT following operative extirpation improves the local control in the tumor bed, whereas controversy continues for its use in stage III disease, except for those with multiple lymph nodes with confirmed extracapsular extension [59]. The National Cancer Database analysis [64] has validated that the adjuvant RT improves overall survival in stage I and II patients, but not in stage III disease. This was further confirmed in a multicenter retrospective study by Servy et al. [65]. which concluded that survival in stage III depends on the presence/absence of subclinical distant metastases rather than the inclusion of specific adjuvant therapy [59].Radiation monotherapy has most commonly been reported in head and neck tumors [59]. Ott et al. [66] reported a prolonged remission in four such patients. Similarly, Lawenda et al. concluded that radiation to the primary tumor bed, either definitive or as an adjuvant following resection, could produce a local control rate exceeding 90% [61]. Mortier et al. demonstrated the validity of managing inoperable cases by RT alone, with the results at least equal to ones managed by surgery and radiotherapy [60]. In addition, good results have been witnessed with single-fraction radiation therapy in metastatic tumors. It reduced the tumor burden with durable palliation and limited side effects [12,13,14,15,16]. Palliation of bone metastases and other extracranial metastatic sites can be achieved with 10 fractions of 3 Gy each and/or a single 8 Gy fraction. The University of Washington reported complete responses in 45% and local control in 77% cases of metastatic tumors when treated with a single 8 Gy fraction [58].Though MCC is generally regarded as a chemotherapy-responsive tumor, results are hardly ever durable. There are no documented favorable results and clear benefits with the use of chemotherapeutic regimens. It is typically reserved for palliative therapy in stage IV disease where other treatments have failed. Cytotoxic chemotherapies tend to increase morbidity and reduce the quality of life with their associated immunosuppression and toxicity. Resistance to chemotherapy on recurrence is another drawback. Usual drug regimens comprise cisplatin/carboplatin with etoposide/topotecan [12,13,14].Immunotherapy has materialized as a promising management tool for advanced MCC. Various research papers have corroborated the association of immune status to clinical outcomes, opening the way for beneficial effects of cell-mediated immunity [67]. Three antibodies targeting the PD-1 axis have been extensively studied, with all exhibiting significant response rates and good response durability (Table 4).Among these, pembrolizumab (anti‚ÄìPD-1) was the first immune inhibitor demonstrating tumor regression [67]. A National Cancer Institute-sponsored clinical trial studied the effect of pembrolizumab in 25 cases of advanced disease, showing an ORR of 56% including a 16% complete response rate (CRR) and an estimated progression-free survival (PFS) of 67% (at 6 months) with the response duration ranging from 2.2 to 9.7 months. ORR did not differ significantly in virus-negative and virus-positive tumors (62% vs. 44%). Based on these observations, pembrolizumab has been recommended for disseminated MCC (National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines). Nghiem et al., in another multicenter phase II trial (Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network-09) involving 50 cases of advanced MCC, treated with pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks) for up to 2 years, showed an objective response rate (ORR) of 56% (complete response 24%; partial response 32%; 95% CI, 41.3% to 70.0%), with ORRs of 59% in virus-positive and 53% in virus-negative tumors. The 24-month PFS rate was 48.3%, and the median PFS time was 16.8 months (95% CI, 4.6 months to not estimable) with the 24-month OS rate of 68.7% [46]. Nivolumab is another monoclonal PD-1 antibody with clinical efficacy in advanced tumors. Twenty-five patients‚Äîtreatment-na√Øve and previously treated (36% and 64%, respectively), MCPyV-positive/negative, advanced MCC‚Äîwere enrolled and treated with nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks with a median follow-up of 51 weeks. Investigators observed an ORR of 64% and PFS of 82% at 3 months. Avelumab, a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, was approved by the FDA in 2017. Approval was based on data from an open-label, single-arm, multi-center phase 2 clinical trial. In this study, 88 patients with advanced stage received avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. This trial demonstrated an ORR of 33%, with a CRR of 11% and PFS of 40% (at 24 weeks) with the estimated PFS of 30% at 12 months. Unlike pembrolizumab, ORR was not significantly different in virus-positive/negative tumors (26% and 35%) [45,68]. The results of the above-described trials led to the inclusion of avelumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab in the NCCN guidelines (in January 2018) as the preferred treatment options for disseminated disease (Table 4) [67,69,70,71]. With the advent of ICIs, for the first time, long-lasting response durability was observed in patients with advanced MCC. Even if adverse events due to checkpoint inhibitors are known, re-induction is a treatment option in case of tumor progression. Stefe et al., in a retrospective multicenter study, evaluated patients with re-induction of anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy; following a mean treatment-free period of 9.5 months (3‚Äì18 months), re-induction with ICI therapy achieved an objective response in five of eight patients (62.5%) upon re-induction, while no response could be observed in the rest. Notably, adverse events compelling halt of treatment were not observed during reinduction [70].A variety of agents belonging to other classes have been tried in some cases. TNF-a, interferon-a (IFN-a), anti-CD56 antibodies, or vaccines (IL-12 gene using vaccine) have all been reported beneficial in case reports or small series. Though case series/reports regarding the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Imatinib, cabozantinib, and pazopanib), and somatostatin analogs (lanreotide, octreotide, and pasireotide) do exist, clinical trials supporting their use have not yet been conducted, therefore, these agents are not included in management protocols [10,12,20]. In advanced tumors, various intralesional immunotherapies were tried. Intralesional therapy with tumor necrosis factor, class I interferon, and talimogene laherparepvec (T-vec) have revealed promising results. Intralesional TLR4 agonist and IL-12 administration (through electroporation) resulted in persistent objective responses in individuals with advanced disease in early-phase trials. Currently, trials are in place for T-vec alone or incorporation with radiation or nivolumab, and TTI-621 (anti-CD47). Furthermore, a phase I/II trial of intralesional TLR7/8 agonist plus a modified IL-2 formulation has been initiated. Though none have been approved yet, still, one more triple-combination study of tremelimumab (an anti‚ÄìCTLA-4 antibody), durvalumab (an anti‚ÄìPD-L1 antibody), and intratumoral TLR3 agonist poly-ICLC is underway [71].  8. ConclusionsAlthough substantial insight into the pathogenesis and advancements in the treatment protocols have been achieved in the recent past, mortality rates and projections have improved little in advanced-stage disease. The tumor stage at the time of presentation is still the most dependable prognostic predictor. Multiple management modalities must be tailored to minimize morbidity while maximizing the chances of survival. The continued development of well-tolerated immuno-therapies with acceptable side effects profiles may improve treatment options for patients with recurrent or persistent disease. Despite the increasing incidence, few institutions manage enough patients that they can effectively analyze the data regarding the efficacy and safety of different treatment options on their own. Hence, prospective, multicenter, randomized case-control studies should be considered to continue to refine and standardize treatment guidelines.

Abstract


BACKGROUNDAngiosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor. Owing to the lack of specific clinical manifestations of this disease, it is difficult to achieve early diagnosis and start early treatment.
CASE SUMMARYA 78-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital because of a bump on his head that did not heal for 4 mo. The patient was diagnosed with a refractory head wound. The patient underwent neoplasm resection and skin grafting surgery in the Plastic Surgery. The neoplasm was sent for pathological examination during the operation. The final pathological results were confirmed scalp angiosarcoma.
CONCLUSIONOur research suggests that pathological examination should be performed for refractory ulcers of the scalp, and physical factor therapy should be used with caution before the diagnosis is clear.

INTRODUCTIONAngiosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor that originates from the endothelial cells of blood vessels or lymphatic vessels and accounts for approximately 1% to 2% of soft tissue sarcomas, of which more than 50% occur in the head and neck, accounting for 0.1% of head and neck malignancies[1]. Because the incidence of scalp angiosarcoma is extremely low, it attracts little clinical attention. Owing to the lack of specific clinical manifestations of this disease, it is difficult to achieve early diagnosis and start early treatment. Some patients suffer from head trauma, and the wound is repeatedly ruptured and is difficult to heal. Angiosarcoma is difficult to diagnose at an early stage, and treatment of the condition is often delayed by mistakenly attributing it to trauma-related abrasions and abscesses. Imaging examinations such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging have a certain value for understanding the location, extent of invasion and whether there is distant metastasis. Thus, timely local tissue biopsy is the main method of diagnosis. The diagnosis is finally confirmed by pathological examination. Recently, the department of rehabilitation of the first hospital of jilin university used physical methods to treat a patient with refractory scalp wounds. The treatment was ineffective. Finally, the pathological examination was used to diagnose scalp angiosarcoma. The report is as follows.CASE PRESENTATIONChief complaintsA 78-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital because of a bump on his head that did not heal for 4 mo. History of present illnessThe patient accidentally bumped his head on a cabinet approximately 4 mo ago, which caused the skin of the top of the skull to rupture. After the injury, the patient was conscious, with headache, no nausea or vomiting, and no ulceration of the lips. There were no abnormal secretions in the nose, mouth and external auditory canal, no incontinence, and no convulsions. Motor movements were normal. The patient had been treated at a local hospital for head wounds, but the wounds did not heal. The patient was sent to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. The outpatient was admitted to the neurosurgery department of our hospital for head and neck refractory wounds, based on the symptoms, signs and examination (October 20, 2017).History of past illnessThere is no obvious history of past illness related to this disease.Personal and family historyThere is no obvious personal or family history related to this disease.Physical examinationOn admission to the hospital, he was conscious; his vital signs were stable, and no enlarged lymph nodes were discovered in the neck or behind the ears. Both muscle strength and muscle tension of the extremities were normal, and voluntary activities were normal. The bilateral Babinski sign and neck stiffness were negative. The ulcerated wound was visible on the top of the skull; the wound was 3 cm √ó 4 cm, and some bloody scabs and granulation tissue could be observed on the top of the wound, with a small amount of secretions and no peculiar smell (Figure 1).

Laboratory examinationsRoutine blood test (October 20, 2017) results were as follows: White blood cell count, 7.30 √ó 109/L (reference value: 3.50-9.50 √ó 109/L); neutrophil percentage: 78% (reference value: 20%-75%). The patient was diagnosed with a refractory head wound. Imaging examinationsBrain CT showed no obvious abnormalities in the skull and brain tissue. MULTIDISCIPLINARY EXPERT CONSULTATIONAfter admission, the patient received routine disinfection treatment. After the wound was fully disinfected, it was covered with sterile gauze, which was fixed with a mesh cap, once every 2 d. After the wound had no secretions, surgical treatment was planned. After 14 d of treatment, the wound showed no signs of healing, with a small amount of secretions still remaining. The patient began feeling pain and was then transferred to the department of rehabilitation. Considering that the patient had a history of trauma and a high white blood cell count, semiconductor laser treatment, ultra violet treatment and ultrashort-wave treatment were administered once a day. After 14 d of treatment, the wound did not heal, and the pain was not relieved. The patient underwent neoplasm resection and skin grafting surgery in the plastic surgery department on November 16, 2017 (Figure 2). The neoplasm was sent for pathological examination during the operation (Figure 3). The rapid pathological results showed angiosarcoma.

             A: Under low magnification: The tumor cells diffusely infiltrated the dermis, involving the skin appendages and ulceration; B: Under high magnification: Proliferated vessels with fissures were composed of vascular endothelial cells with heteromorphic hyperplasia and nucleoli, and red blood cells were extravasated; C: Under high magnification: The intense positivity for an antiCD34 antibody shows that angiosarcomatous cells formed irregular vessels; D: Under high magnification: A high mitotic index was confirmed by immunohistochemical study for Ki67.
        


TREATMENTNo tumor was observed on the front, back, left, and right margins, but the tumor was close to the undercut margin. The patient was advised to undergo radiotherapy, but he discontinued the treatment and was discharged. OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UPA follow-up was continued after the discharge. In March 2018, the wound on the top of the head ruptured again, and disinfection was conducted at home. In August 2018, the patient passed away, the cause of death is the recurrence of tumor.DISCUSSIONAngiosarcoma, also known as malignant hemangioendothelioma, is a malignant tumor of blood vessels, originating from endothelial cells. Angiosarcoma can occur in various parts of the body[2,3], such as the head, neck, breasts, limbs and trunk, and most of the tumor is mainly located in the skin. Because of different clinical manifestations and biological behaviors of these malignant vascular proliferations, Enzinger and Weiss in 1983 divided these tumors into 4 groups according to their location: (1) Cutaneous angiosarcoma not related to lymphedema; (2) Angiosarcoma of the skin related to lymphedema, namely, lymphangiosarcoma; (3) Deep soft tissue angiosarcoma; and (4) Breast angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma of the scalp is the most common form, which mainly affects the skin of the head[4]. This disease occurs more often in the elderly. The skin lesions are characterized by infiltration and expansion to the surrounding or subcutaneous tissues, which involve the scalp, before metastasis. Owing to these extensive infiltrations, the edges of the damage are often unclear. The disease progresses rapidly and can be spread to nearby lymph nodes or to the lungs, liver, bones, etc., through blood circulation. Owing to its highly aggressive and multifocal nature, the prognosis of angiosarcoma is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 35%. Moreover, 75% of patients have local recurrence within 24 mo of local treatment[5].There is currently no radical cure for angiosarcoma, and the prognosis is poor. The importance of early diagnosis and early treatment is emphasized. Scalp angiosarcoma is the first choice for extensive surgical resection. As far as possible, extensive surgical resection of skin lesions should be performed; otherwise, angiosarcoma is prone to recurrence. For those with multiple or extensive skin lesions, which are difficult to operate, radiotherapy can be used before or after surgery. For patients with distant metastases, chemotherapy-based treatment is the main option, but there is currently no standard chemotherapy regimen[6], and the remission period is short. Cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, vincristine and dacarbazine are often used clinically. Ye et al[7] believed that scalp angiosarcoma recurred and metastasized after surgery. After failure of a first-line chemotherapy, docetaxel, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and radiotherapy can be administered to patients to prolong their overall survival time. For patients with a poor physical status or an old age, monotherapy with taxanes is recommended[8]. For general refractory wounds, using appropriate physical methods can promote wound healing. The patient in this case was older, had high neutrophils in the blood routine at the first visit, exuded fluid on the scalp ulcer wound, had a risk of infection, and could not be treated directly by surgery. Therefore, local physical factor treatment was adopted to reduce the wound exudate and prevent wound infection, but the treatment effect was not ideal, and wound healing was not promoted. The pathological results allowed us to confirm the patient's diagnosis as scalp angiosarcoma. Physical factor therapy is ineffective for scalp angiosarcoma, and it should be noted that some physical factor therapy is contraindicated for the treatment of local tumors. In future clinical work, pathological examination should be performed for refractory ulcers in any part of the skin, and physical factors should be used with caution before the diagnosis is clear, because this may delay the correct treatment plan.CONCLUSIONOur research suggests that pathological examination should be performed for refractory ulcers of the scalp, and physical factor therapy should be used with caution before the diagnosis is clear.

AbstractPurpose of ReviewSummarize the writings published in the last years on the management and novel therapies of mucosal¬†melanoma (MM).Recent FindingsNew research has demonstrated a difference between MM and cutaneous melanoma (CM) in their genomic¬†and molecular landscapes, explaining the response's heterogeneity. Immunotherapy and targeted therapy have limited benefit,¬†but novel therapies are rapidly expanding.SummaryMM is aggressive cancer occurring in gastrointestinal, respiratory, or urogenital mucosa; whose incidence is greater in the¬†Asian population. The etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear since UV exposure is not a proven risk factor as in cutaneous¬†melanoma. In contrast to CM, lesions on the mucosal surface are less likely to be recognized early; therefore, the disease¬†is diagnosed in an advanced stage. Clinical manifestations, such as bleeding or pain, can help to detect this tumor, although¬†the prognosis remains unfavorable with an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 20%.¬†The mutational landscape of MM includes mutations of BRAF and NRAS, as well as mutations in the c-KIT/CD117 gene (in 50% of patients), thus limiting therapeutic interventions to immunotherapy. However, clinical studies show¬†less responsiveness to immunotherapy compared to CM, therefore novel therapeutic strategies targeting new molecules are¬†needed to improve the survival of patients with MM.

IntroductionMelanoma develops from melanocytes that originate from the neural crest and migrate to many tissues during embryogenesis [1]. The biology and clinical outcome of cutaneous melanoma (CM) is different from that of mucosal or ocular melanoma [2]. MM accounts for 1,3% of all melanomas, and develops in non-sun-exposed areas, including the mucous membranes of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts.To date, the risk factors are poorly understood and the pathogenesis remains unclear [3], although an association with human papillomavirus and herpesvirus has been described [1]. In contrast to CM, the diagnosis of mucosal evolutive lesions is more difficult and MM is therefore likely to be detected at a late stage [2]. As a result, MM is usually diagnosed late, and malignant cells are often surrounded by a rich vascular and lymphatic network, which is mostly considered to be the cause of aggressive behaviour and poor prognosis. [2]. The molecular landscape includes a lower incidence of BRAF oncogene mutations but a high frequency of KIT mutations, suggesting a distinct genetic origin with respect to CM [2]. The overall five-year survival rate for MM is 10‚Äì20% [1]. However, new therapeutic strategies have the potential to improve the outcome of MM, which has a poor response to immunotherapy [1]. Here, we present a comprehensive review of different primary MM, their epidemiological and clinical features, and therapeutic strategies.EpidemiologyMucosal melanoma is a rare and aggressive subtype, accounting for 0.8‚Äì3.7% of all melanomas in Caucasians [1]. In contrast to CM, whose incidence is steadily increasing, the incidence of MM is almost stable and is more likely to affect women than men (2.8 versus 1.5 per million) [1]. The incidence of MM is also influenced by age, with more than 65% of patients over 60¬†years of age and less than 3% under 30¬†years of age. Racial differences in incidence have been reported. Although ethnicity influences the onset of MM, the absolute incidence remains higher in Caucasian populations [1]. The incidence is higher in Caucasians, but Asians have a higher incidence of MM arising from the anorectal tract, whereas non-Hispanic whites have a higher incidence of genitourinary MM [2, 4]. Finally, Hispanics most commonly present with MM of the head and neck [3].Etiopathogenesis and Clinical FeaturesMelanocytes are not found exclusively in the epidermis, iris, and hair but also in the inner ear, nervous system, heart as well as mucous membranes [1, 2]. Based on recent studies, melanocytes produce many molecules in consequence of UV exposure as cytokines, melanocortin, amines, and nitric oxide (NO), thus promoting melanogenesis [1]. As recently reported, keratinocytes, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, mast cells, and endothelial cells may represent potential targets of these secretory compounds. In addition, Œ±-MSH controls the production of NO by melanocytes while and melanocortins promote other signals that are considered key regulators of skin and mucous membrane homeostasis [2, 3]. Notably, MM is not associated with UV exposition and those arising from the anorectal tract tend to affect patients with red hair and poor tanning history [5]. Because the pathogenesis of MM is unrelated to typical carcinogens, there is poor evidence to support a link between cigarettes, formaldehyde, or exposure to cancer-causing viruses (i.e., papillomavirus, herpes virus, or polyomavirus) [2, 6]. For example, regarding the head and neck MM, melanocytes could play a key role in the metabolization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [7, 8]. However, the origin and pathogenetic mechanisms remain still undefined [3]. In the context of clinical presentation, the MM are lesions with irregularity of borders, altered pigmentation, and elevated areas. In contrast to many CM, which in general can be easily detected, lesions occurring in the mucosal surfaces are less likely to be detected early in their evolution [2]. On the other hand, the clinical symptoms depend on the site of onset of melanoma, and in the case of head and neck lesions, blood streaks can be observed in the nasal secretions, epistaxis, proptosis, diplopia, and pain [2].Mucosal Melanomas of the Respiratory TractMucosal melanomas of the respiratory tract are rare and arise from melanocytes of the ectodermal mucosa. The nasal cavity and sinuses are common sites (about 4% of all sino-nasal neoplasms) [2] whereas it is extremely rare in the larynx and tracheobronchial tract [9]. By contrast, the lung is frequently colonized by melanoma metastases of cutaneous, ocular, or mucosal origin [9].Most patients suffer from nasal obstruction, visible mass and epistaxis that in some cases cause pain, morphological changes of the face, ptosis, and diplopia. Laryngeal mucosal melanoma is extremely rare and there are approximately 60 cases reported [9]. This subtype affects generally males in the sixth and seventh decade [1]. It causes hoarseness, followed by throat irritation but also sore throat, dysphagia, neck swelling, and pain [10] Primary tracheal melanoma is a very rare cancer with four cases reported showing clinical manifestations that resemble other tracheal tumors as airway obstruction, dyspnea and stridor as well as hoarseness, cough and hemoptysis. In most cases, the treatment consists of palliative surgery for restoring the airway or tracheal resection [11]. Primary lung melanoma is an extremely rare cancer with around 30 cases described whereas the lung is a common metastatic site. [12]. Endobronchial growth is often peripheral and is detected by bronchoscopy as a pigmented or non-pigmented lesion [1].Mucosal Melanomas of the Gastrointestinal TractMucosal melanoma frequently affectes the oral cavity and the anal canal (33% and 31% of patients respectively), while other sites such as the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or gallbladder are rarely involved. Only 14% of patients with primary MM of the gastrointestinal tract are under the age of 50, and about 50% are over the age of 70. [12]The incidence of oral MM is reported to be 0.2 per million [13], and it develops as a de novo asymptomatic melanocytic lesion with the onset of bleeding or pain. Melanoma of the oesophageal mucosa is rare, accounting for only 0.1‚Äì0.2% of all oesophageal neoplasms [14]. It is frequently located in the central and distal esophagus, whereas only in 10% of cases is proximal, in 60¬†years old male patients: males actually have approximately twice the incidence as females. Symptoms include dysphagia but also retrosternal pain, weight loss, and rarely hematemesis or melaena.On endoscopy, lesions appear hyperpigmented and ulcerated with satellite nodules [15]. The stomach is rarely involved in melanoma and only a few cases have been reported. Symptoms are non-specific and include abdominal pain, weight loss, upper gastrointestinal bleeding and anaemia [3]. Although primary small bowel melanoma is very rare, it is the most common site of gastrointestinal melanoma metastases. Patients typically present with nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding with secondary anaemia, and intussusception. [1].The most common type of GI melanoma, with an estimated incidence rate of 0.4 per million, is anorectal mucosal melanoma [2]. It is the third most common site after cutaneous and ocular melanoma due to malignant transformation of anal and rectal melanocytes. Anal and rectal melanoma occurs most commonly in the seventh decade of life, with a higher incidence in women and a prevalence in Caucasians [1, 16]. It causes rectal bleeding, pain or discomfort and is often diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage. The tumor is usually polypoid, ulcerated with or without pigmentation. Primary colorectal melanoma is rare. The average age of patients is 60¬†years, regardless of sex, with a predilection for the right colon [17]. Abdominal pain and weight loss are common complaints. Primary biliary tract melanoma is extremely rare and may arise in the gallbladder or bile duct. Presenting symptoms are gallstones or cholecystitis, which cause obstructive jaundice, pain, itching and dark urine. Biliary tract melanomas are often metastatic and present as flat, pigmented lesions, whereas primary lesions are often single polypoid lesions on macroscopic examination [18].Mucosal Melanomas of the Urogenital TractUrogenital tract melanoma is more common in females of Caucasian ethnicity in about 90% of cases [19]. They develop in the vulva, vagina, cervix, urethra, and urinary bladder. The female genital tract accounts for 18% of MM and 3% of those of the urinary tract; the most common site is vulvar (76.7%) followed by vaginal (19.8%), while cervical melanoma is the least common [1]. The second most frequent vulvar cancer is vulvar melanoma. [19] Symptoms include bleeding, lumps or masses in the vulvar area, itching, pain or irritation, discomfort, and discharge. [20] Vaginal melanoma affects 80% of postmenopausal older women with an average age of about 60¬†years are affected by vaginal melanoma [20]. Pain, mass lesions, and vaginal bleeding and discharge are the most typical presenting symptoms [21]. It appears macroscopically as a variety of pigmented lesion that is fragile, easily bleeds, and ulcerated in half of the cases [1]. Melanoma of the cervix is extremely rare [22] and appears as a variously pigmented or amelanotic exophytic cervical mass. Melanoma of the urethra accounts for about 4% of all urethral malignancies [23] and mostly affects elderly women in the distal tract of the urethra.In about 20% of cases, MM of the urethra is amelanotic and has polypoid growth, therefore is mistaken for a urethral polyp, mucous prolapse, or urothelial tumor [24]. In the literature, 20 cases of urinary bladder melanoma are reported, underlying the rarity of this neoplasm. Clinical manifestations include hematuria and dysuria and it is often locally advanced at diagnosis [25, 26].The Genetic Landscape of Mucosal MelanomaNon-cutaneous melanoma shows different genetic alterations compared to CM, without a clear molecular target pathway [1, 8].Specifically, MM has a lower burden of somatic mutations as well as UV-related genetic mutations that are widely described in CM [27].As in cutaneous and acral melanoma, the mutational profile categorizes MM into different molecular groups: BRAF-mutated; RAS-mutated; NF1-loss; and triple wild-type (absence of mutations in BRAF, RAS and NF1; but the presence of KIT mutations and/or amplifications) [28].The main pathways involved in the development of MM are summarised in Fig.¬†1.Fig. 1Main signaling pathways involved in melanoma proliferation: activation of the MAPK signaling cascade and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway dysregulation by several oncogenes. Also, TERT promoter mutation is linked to the survival, invasion, and metastasis of melanomaFull size imageThe main subtype is characterized by an activating mutation of BRAF, which is involved in MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling, followed by the NRAS mutated group [28].Activation of MAPK is a major cause of cell proliferation in melanomas that arise on non-chronically sun-damaged skin [29]. However, BRAF/NRAS-activating mutations are less frequently mutated in MM compared to CM [30]: 6% and 8%, respectively, versus 50% and 28% in CM, with a variable incidence depending on the anatomical district of melanoma occurrence [31].According to Beaudoux‚Äôs meta-analysis, head and neck MMs have the highest percentage of BRAF mutations, while NRAS mutations are more frequently mutated in MMs of the urinary tract. Surprisingly, the BRAF and NRAS mutations in MM are more similar to those found in tumors such as lung cancer, suggesting an unidentified link to some genotoxic agents [32].Indeed, MM may present atypical mutations of BRAF (non-V600) and NRAS (located on codons G12, G13, as well as codon Q61), uncovered in patients affected by a more aggressive disease, not responsive to traditional BRAF and MEK inhibitors, but possibly sensitive to next generation of MEK inhibitors [33].The third subtype, NF1 loss is around 16% of MM [34] and determines the constitutive activation of Ras proteins. Interestingly, co-mutation of NF1 and KIT is found in 32% of MMs (compared to only 4% for CMs), resulting in upregulation of MAPK cascade [2, 35].KIT/CD117 gene aberrations predominate in MM as opposed to CM [8, 34]. At least 31 mutations involving c-KIT affecting exons 9, 11, 13, 17, and 18 have been described [36] in metastatic melanoma. Some research revealed that the disease‚Äôs early and late stages are both characterized by c-KIT immunoreactivity [36], but whether mutations occur at the onset of melanoma or during the advanced stage due to mutation accumulation, remains unclear. Moreover, Gong et al. showed that similar to BRAF and NRAS mutations, the frequency of c-KIT mutation in melanoma is influenced by the anatomical site of the primary tumor: genitalia and extremities having the highest mutation rate (of 26 to 35%), anorectal melanoma expresses in 35% of cases cKIT mutations, while in sinonasal tract cKIT mutations are observed in 22% of MM [37].As mentioned above, cKIT mutations distinguish the subtype of triple-negative melanoma, often associated with the activation of splicing factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1), a protein involved in RNA splicing and transcriptomic regulation (with a higher trend of R625C and R625H mutations in vulvovaginal and anal or rectal melanomas) [36] and Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations. The overexpression of TERT, which is present in about 30% of head and neck MMs, gives cells the ability to become immortal and therefore aggressive behavior [38, 39].St.rikingly, some observations uncovered that Sprout-related EVH1 domain-containing protein 1 (SPRED1) loss promotes cell proliferation in KIT-driven melanoma, as a result of SPRED1's function as a tumor suppressor in the MAPK pathway. According to previous studies, SPRED1 acts downstream of KIT but upstream of RAF by directly repressing Ras [39]. The MAPK signal induced by KIT activation may be significantly enhanced by SPRED1 loss, implying the possibility that the co-existence of SPRED1 loss and KIT-activating mutations is linked to resistance to KIT inhibitors [40, 41].Besides, triple wild-type MMs tend to have CCND1/cyclin D1 or cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 amplification, acting as an alternative driver in BRAF or NRAS-mediated proliferation signaling mechanisms [2] through activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways. This explains a lack of response to antitumor therapy and a worse prognosis for this melanoma subtype [42].As reported by Wang et alresearch‚Äôs, older MM patients who have higher levels of CDK4 protein expression have lower 3-year survival [43]. Other uncommon mutations are in TP53 (9% of cases), ATP-dependent helicase (ATRX) (in 6% of MM), and Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) inactivation through methylation of the¬†PTEN¬†promoter, a rare occurrence involved in the development of Sinonasal MM [44].PTEN loss and amplification of CDK4/6 pathways upset the immune system's delicate balance, resulting in immunosuppression and decreased response to immunotherapy [43].Moreover, the low mutational load described in MM as well as poor expression of death ligand 1 (PD-L1) compared to CM, limits T cell activation contributing to immunotherapy resistance [39, 45].In conclusion, several reports identified mutations GNAQ/11 in 9.5% of patients with MM, without clear therapeutic implications. GNAQ and GNA11 are involved in many physiological and pathological processes such as hydrolysis‚Äôs regulation of GTP [46]. Mutations of GNAQ and GNA11 are relatively low (4.6% and 4.9%, respectively) for MM, unlike the data for uveal melanoma characterized by a frequency of GNAQ mutation ranging from 36 and 53%. Furthermore, metastatic MM patients bearing GNAQ/11 mutations showed a shorter median survival than wild-type, supporting a probable correlation with clinical progression. [47].Hence, MMs have a uniquely complex genomic profile that influences their pathogenesis and aggressiveness, explaining the poor response to systemic therapies.Surgical Treatment and Systemic TreatmentLocal DiseaseRadical tumor excision is the first approach for locally advanced MM with disease-free surgical margins [48]. However, the anatomical complexity of the region, the metastatic stage at diagnosis, and proximity to vital structures (especially for head-neck tumors) make it difficult to achieve radical surgery [46, 48]. Although challenging surgery procedures, local recurrence is common, particularly in cases of inadequate resection, vascular invasion, and large tumor size [49, 50]. In the head and neck, the median time to first recurrence is 6 to 12¬†months [51]. Surgery can be paired with adjuvant irradiation to improve local control in patients with clinical lymph node involvement or extracapsular extension [52], although the radiotherapy efficacy is debatable because local failure occurs in half of the patients, and overall survival benefit has not been observed. Sentinel¬†lymph node¬†biopsy (SLNB) is reserved for vulvar and anal melanoma, but its role is controversial because inguinal lymphadenectomy does not improve survival. Therefore, bilateral nodal dissection is performed in patients who have a clinically node-positive disease, eligible for further adjuvant systemic treatment [53].Due to the diagnostic delay and advanced stage of presentation, systemic therapy is often palliative while adjuvant treatment shows a marginal role. To date, BRAF mutation is mandatory in stage III or IV melanoma [54].In BRAF wild-type tumors, adjuvant immunotherapy with antibodies targeting PD-1, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab, is a viable choice. In BRAF-mutated MM, targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors is an option, in addition to adjuvant immunotherapy [55].Nevertheless, most trials have enrolled patients with cutaneous melanoma, except for CheckMate 238, whereby 29/906 patients with MM were included, to evaluate adjuvant Nivolumab, or Ipilimumab in resected stage IIIB, IIIC, and IV melanoma. Interestingly, Japanese subgroup analysis revealed a low efficacy of Nivolumab in mucosal melanoma than in cutaneous melanoma (51.7% in the nivolumab arm vs 41.7% in the ipilimumab arm) [56]. Despite the effectiveness advantage of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in CheckMate 067 [57] for metastatic melanoma, no such recurrence-free survival improvement was observed in the adjuvant setting in CheckMate 915, with lower ipilimumab dose in both cutaneous and mucosal melanoma (7% of the population in the combination arm) [58].Adjuvant chemotherapy was investigated in a phase III trial of 204 resected MM patients. This trial evaluated temozolomide plus cisplatin versus one year of interferon-alfa-2b [59]. In preliminary evidence, at a median follow-up of 24¬†months, chemotherapy improved relapse-free survival (median 15.5 versus 9.5¬†months) and distant metastasis-free survival (median 16.8¬†months versus 9.6¬†months). To date, chemotherapy should not be considered the standard of care but exclusively offered to patients not suited for immunotherapy or targeted therapy [60]. Regardless of local diseases, neoadjuvant therapy is evolving. At a median follow-up of 59¬†weeks, neoadjuvant toripalimab (a humanized antibody targeting PD1) plus axitinib (a selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] receptor tyrosine kinases 1, 2, and 3) revealed a complete pathologic response rate of 29 percent in a phase II study of 21 patients with resectable MM, representing a new opportunity [61].Unresectable and Metastatic DiseaseIn patients with metastatic MM lacking a BRAF mutation, a combination of immunotherapy has provided a promising therapeutic approach, albeit clinical studies show less responsiveness compared to cutaneous melanoma [62]. A 5-year subanalysis of the Checkmate 067 trial about mucosal melanoma patients reported a considerably higher objective response rate (ORR) (43%¬†vs. 7%), and Overall Survival (OS) rate (36%¬†vs. 7%) in 79 patients with MM treated with combined Nivolumab and Ipilimumab vs ipilimumab alone [63], while Nivolumab monotherapy was associated with 30% of ORR and 17 % of OS rate. This data is confirmed by D‚ÄôAngelo et al. pooled analysis of five trials (CA209-003, CA209-038, CheckMate-037, CheckMate-066, and CheckMate-067). Despite the median reduction in tumor burden being -34.2% for combination therapy in the subgroup of MM as compared to cutaneous melanoma patients, ORR and PFS are lower (37 vs 60% and 5.9 versus 11.7¬†months, respectively). Notably, the response rate is higher in patients with an assessment of PDL1‚Äâ>‚Äâ5% (53.3%¬†versus¬†12.2% in PD-L1‚Äâ<‚Äâ5).Regarding safety, the most common immune-related events in grades 3 or 4 were rash and diarrhea, higher for combination therapy [58, 64].A regimen with pembrolizumab was assessed in several studies, confirming Nivolumab data of ORR (19%), the median PFS (2.8¬†months), and the median OS (11.3¬†months) [65].Interestingly, clinical outcomes in Asian patients are less favorable than in Caucasian individuals.Keynote 041 phase Ib study, evaluating the safety of pembrolizumab in Japanese patients with metastatic melanoma, showed an ORR of 25% for MM [66]. Moreover, in the Keynote-151 trial and Polaris-01 trial, which investigated pembrolizumab and toripalimab, in the Chinese population with advanced/metastatic MM, the anti-PD1 therapy achieved an ORR of 13.3% and 0%, respectively [67]. Probably, these results reflect the immunotherapy resistance in the Asian group, which had a higher rate of KIT mutations, in addition to lower expression of PD-L1, and lower tumor¬†mutational burden [68,69,70].Based on c-KIT mutations, agents targeting c-KIT have been examined in mucosal melanoma. According to the results of a retrospective study investigating imatinib's (a c-KIT inhibitor) effectiveness in patients with MM who had KIT mutations or amplification., ORR observed was 21.9%, the overall disease control rate of 60%, and an OS of 13¬†months and PFS of 4¬†months [71].In this regard, the KIT exon 11 and 13 mutations demonstrate sensitivity to KIT inhibitors, while KIT exon 17 mutations and KIT amplifications show no response to imatinib or similar drugs [72]. Another tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dasatinib, targeting mutation in cKIT exon 11-L572P, has been assessed in the ECOG-ACRINE2607 trial, administered 70¬†mg twice daily in mucosal, acral, or vulvovaginal melanoma. The results were unsuccessful because PFS and OS were low regardless of cKIT status or subtypes [73]. Thus, Imatinib remains a treatment option for patients with a¬†KIT¬†mutation who progressed or suffered adverse events after immunotherapy.Furthermore, the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors is less effective in MM, probably as a consequence of NF1 loss of function mutations or deletions linked to BRAF inhibitor resistance, while no effect of NRAS mutation on metastatic melanoma characteristics or outcomes of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy is noted [75].Data from the Italian Melanoma Intergroup underlie the predictive role of intratumoral CD8‚Äâ+‚ÄâT cells in targeted therapy in terms of PFS and OS [75].Another promising therapeutic strategy includes targeting NF1. NF1 mutation is associated with better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, [76] but also worse overall survival for patients with NF1 WT. Jour et al. found a high expression of MK167 (Marker of Proliferation Ki-67) and CDC20 in these patients, thus suggesting a relation between the nuclear accumulation of CDC20 transcripts and worse prognosis. In this study, MAPK pathway and CDC20 co-inhibition resulted in cytotoxic and cytostatic effects, decreasing CDC20 expression in many NF1-mutant cell lines, supporting the idea that inhibition of CDC20 and MAPK pathways may be a new option for NF1 mutated melanoma [77].Conclusions and Future PerspectivesDue to the less effectiveness of immunotherapy compared to cutaneous melanoma, numerous ongoing trials are exploring new combination therapies (Table 1). The combination of anti-angiogenic therapy and immunotherapy results in increases in the number of TILs and inhibits tumor growth in murine cancer models [78]. A single-center, phase Ib trial assays the preliminary efficacy and safety of toripalimab in combination with axitinib in patients with advanced Melanoma [79, 80]. Twenty-nine Asian patients with MM received axitinib and toripalimab every 2¬†weeks, 14 patients had a partial response, the median OS still not reached after (at 1.5¬†years of follow-up), and a longer PFS and a better ORR were found in PD-L1-positive tumor.Table 1 A summary of clinical studies (recruiting, active or not yet recruiting) for the perioperative and advanced setting of mucosal melanoma (sources: clinicaltrials.gov)Full size tableFurthermore, the angiogenesis signatures might be considered an applicable biomarker for anti-VEGF plus immunotherapy, although VEGF signaling has an important immune-modulating function in the microenvironment [80]. Likewise, pembrolizumab plus Lenvatinib (another vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor) revealed a potential anticancer effect in patients with advanced melanoma. In the LEAP-003 trial, this combination is currently ongoing also for patients with acral and mucosal melanomas [81]. Similar minor clinical studies of combination treatments for mucosal melanoma are also underway and recruiting patients, as well as trials with Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) or apatinib (anti-VEGFR2) plus temozolomide (alkylating agent similar to dacarbazine) [NCT03422445]; radiation plus ICI in mucosal melanoma of the head and neck [NCT04318717]; Camrelizumab (an anti-PD1), plus anlotinib (multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and nab-paclitaxel. Promising combinations with ICI under evaluation include MDM2 inhibitor (APG-115) and aldesleukin (NCT03611868, NCT02748564) or single-agent nemvaleukin (NCT04830124). Nevertheless, most of these studies enrolled Asian patients, most frequently affected by this neoplasm. In MM, CDK4 amplification and/or CCND1 amplification and/or p16 (CDKN2A) loss leads to the dysregulation of cell cycle progression, which justifies the rationale of targeting CDK4/6 in some preclinical and clinical trials [82]. Another intriguing target for MM is ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related (ATR) kinase. An orally available morpholino-pyrimidine-based inhibitor of this molecule is investigated in a phase 2 trial in combination with anti-PD-L-1 in unresectable or advanced melanoma and primary or secondary resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition, to date an unmet clinical need [NCT05061134].Hence, even if the combination treatments could enhance long-term outcomes in this rare and aggressive subtype of melanoma, we must consider clinic-pathological features and mutational profiles of a single patient to open the road for novel treatment targets [83]. In this scenario, where traditional therapies are less effective, further prospective umbrella clinical trials are critical to promoting precision medicine and inclusion of the non-Asian population, despite the higher incidence in Orient.To date, several clinical studies conducted for neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies are focused on exploring an innovative strategy, dealing with this tumor in the earliest setting.

Abstract:
  Simple SummaryMucosal melanoma (MM) is a rare melanoma subtype that affects mucosal surfaces of the head and neck, anorectal region, and vulvovaginal area. Due to its rarity, the management, monitoring, and treatment of MM lack standardization, often relying on protocols designed for cutaneous melanoma (CM). In this retrospective, registry-based cohort study, we analyzed epidemiological and histological data together with the treatments administered to gain insights into the disease‚Äôs behavior, treatment patterns, and potential predictors of survival. Our findings reveal that lower disease stage, thinner Breslow depth, and surgical resection are associated with improved overall survival, while age, sex, radiotherapy, and BRAF mutant status do not significantly affect survival. Standard systemic management typically includes immunotherapy (anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4). For cases with BRAF or c-KIT mutations, targeted therapies may be considered. The prognosis is unfavorable, with a survival rate of less than 50% at 2 years.  AbstractMucosal melanoma (MM) is an uncommon melanoma subtype affecting mucosal surfaces of the head and neck, anorectal region, and vulvovaginal area. We aimed to present our experience at a tertiary-level hospital regarding MM diagnosis, management, monitoring of progression, mutations, and outcome predictors. We performed a registry-based cohort study including MM cases diagnosed from 2012 to 2022 and retrospectively characterized somatic mutations on BRAF, NRAS and c-KIT. We employed Kaplan‚ÄìMeier curves, log-rank tests, and Cox regression analysis to explore prognostic factors and survival outcomes in a cohort of 35 patients, mainly women (63%) with a median age of 70 years. Predominantly, MM occurred in the vulvovaginal region (48.6%). At diagnosis, 28.6% had lymph node involvement, and 31.4% also had distant metastasis. Mutations in BRAF and c-KIT were identified in 3/35 (9%) and 2/6 patients (33%), respectively. Surgery was performed in 71.4% of patients, and most received systemic treatment (65.7%). Lower disease stage, thinner Breslow depth, and surgical resection were associated with improved overall survival. Notably, age, sex, radiotherapy, and BRAF mutant status did not affect survival. Standard management typically involves immunotherapy. Cases with BRAF or c-KIT mutations may be considered for targeted therapies. Unfortunately, MM prognosis remains unfavorable, with a less than 50% survival rate at 2 years.

  1. IntroductionMelanomas are malignant neoplasms originating from melanocytes, which arise from neural crest cells and undergo migration through embryonic mesenchyme to reach their ultimate location. Most melanocytes are found in the epidermis and dermis, but they can also be found in diverse extracutaneous sites including the ocular region, mucosal tissues, and leptomeninges [1,2].Primary MM include melanomas occurring in the head and neck mucosa, anorectal region, vulvovaginal area, and urinary tract, ranked in order of frequency. MM accounts for 1% of all melanomas, and its incidence is stable, in contrast to CM, which is experiencing an increasing incidence [3,4,5,6].MM tends to manifest at advanced ages in comparison to CM, with a median age of diagnosis at 70 years. Moreover, it is more frequently identified in women, primarily due to the prevalence of vulvovaginal melanoma, which represents the most common subtype affecting women. In men, the head and neck region emerge as the principal site of MM [1,4,5,7].Risk factors contributing to the onset of MM have yet to be definitively established [2,8]. Unlike CM, there is no association between ultraviolet radiation exposure and the development of MM [3]. Previous studies have explored viral exposures such as human papillomavirus [9], human herpes virus [10], and polyomavirus [11], as well as exposure to formaldehyde [12], as potential risk factors. However, these factors are not widely regarded as significant causes of MM. In the case of oral MM, cigarette smoking has been proposed as a risk factor, as studies have indicated a higher prevalence of oral pigmented lesions among smokers [13].The underlying mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of MM remain unclear. In contrast to CM, which commonly exhibits oncogenic mutations in BRAF, such mutations are rarely observed in MM. However, activating mutations of c-KIT are more frequently detected in MM [2,3,5,14,15,16].The clinical manifestation of MM often lacks specificity and varies depending on the site of origin [1]. The absence of early and distinct indicators, along with the hidden locations of the disease, in addition to frequent nodal and/or metastatic involvement at the time of diagnosis, are common factors contributing to an unfavorable prognosis and diminished survival rates.There are few studies describing both the clinical characteristics and management of MM. In this study, our main objective is to describe the management of MM in a tertiary-level hospital regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of MM, while also describing the frequency of common mutations and predictors of outcome.  2. Materials and Methods  2.1. Study Design and Data SourceWe conducted a retrospective and descriptive registry-based cohort study at Vall d‚ÄôHebron University Hospital (Barcelona, Spain), reviewing the Pathology Department‚Äôs database to identify all cases of MM diagnosed between 1 January 2012, and 31 December 2022, resulting in a total of 35 cases. The study included cases of MM located in the head and neck region (nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and oral cavity), vulvovaginal region, anorectal region, and the rest of the digestive tract. Duplicate cases were excluded, where multiple biopsies were taken from the same patient, along with metastatic melanomas from primary CM. Following a systematized protocol, demographic and clinical data (age, sex, race, immunosuppressive state and smoking habit, tumor location, first symptom, description of the primary lesion, staging and treatment modalities), histopathological variables such as thickness (i.e., Breslow depth according to the College of American Pathologists guidelines depending on tumor location), and therapeutic and follow-up information were recorded from each patient through chart review. Survival time was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of death caused by the disease or, in case of no death or death from some other cause, the date of last follow-up/date of death.Additionally, somatic mutations were retrospectively analyzed in the 35 samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the BRAF/NRAS mutation test LSR (Roche Diagnostics). DNA extraction was performed from formalin-fixed‚Äìparaffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks using a COBAS DNA Sample preparation kit.Given the complexity in establishing a unified staging system across diverse anatomical sites, we categorized staging into three groups: localized disease (Localized), nodal dissemination (Nodal), and distant metastatic disease (Distant).  2.2. Statistical AnalysisDescriptive and univariate statistics were computed as customary; the sample size was modest and nonparametric tests were used. Clinical and histological characteristics of the tumors were compared by anatomical location and stage using the Fisher‚Äôs exact test and the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test, as appropriate, unless stated otherwise. Post hoc tests with adjusted p-values were carried out if the omnibus test was statistically significant.Kaplan‚ÄìMeier curves were generated to compare survival between selected clinical or histological characteristics, and log-rank tests were used to ascertain differences between these groups. Cox proportional-hazards models (hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI)) were used to estimate the risk of overall mortality. Age, sex, and disease stage at diagnosis (localized, nodal, and distant) were included as potential confounders in these models.All tests were two-tailed and p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.2.2 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria, 2023).  3. Results  3.1. Characteristics of Patients and Tumors at BaselineA retrospective analysis was conducted from 35 patients diagnosed with MM with a median follow-up of 21 months and total person-time follow-up of 936 months. Most patients were female with an observed sex ratio of 1.7:1 (62.9% females versus 37.1% males; p = 0.001; see Table 1). The median age at initial diagnosis was 70 years, ranging from 44 to 95 years, with no significant differences between anatomical sites. The vulvovaginal region was the most frequent (48.6% among females), encompassing melanomas located in both the vulva (n = 12) and the vagina (n = 5). The head and neck region was the second most common location (28.6%, n = 10), including cases in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses (n = 5) and the oral cavity and lip mucosa (n = 5). Gastrointestinal tract melanomas, including the anorectal region (n = 7) and esophagus (n = 1), were observed in eight patients (22.8%). Two of the patients were immunocompromised due to lung transplantation.The first symptom observed among all patients was attributed to the progressive enlargement of the primary tumor, with the sole exception of an individual where the clinical presentation encompassed perceived growth of the primary tumor along with regional node enlargement. Clinical images of two patients are displayed in Figure 1. In vulvovaginal cases, bleeding was the most prevalent symptom, followed by the vulvar or vaginal tumor observation. For anorectal cases, rectorrhagia emerged as the predominant clinical presentation, while esophageal case primarily manifested as dysphagia. In head and neck melanomas, we could not identify a predominant initial symptom; the presentation depended on the exact site of involvement, with epistaxis or nasal obstruction in cases involving the nasal cavity, as well as the presence of ulceration in melanomas arising in the oral cavity.The predominant cause of death among deceased patients was attributed to the progression of MM, with only two exceptions: one case resulted from cardiovascular disease, while another was due to respiratory insufficiency.  3.2. Breslow and StagingAt diagnosis, 14 cases (40%) presented with localized disease, whereas 10 cases (28.6%) also demonstrated lymph node involvement, without concurrent distant metastases. Additionally, 10 cases (28.6%) displayed both lymph node involvement and concurrent distant metastases, while a patient presented with distant metastases in the absence of lymph node involvement. Lymph node involvement was detected in 17 out of 20 clinically or using imaging studies. Positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) scan was the most common modality (52.9%), followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT (each 20%). In three cases, the lymph node metastases were microscopically detected by selective sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (15%).There were no differences observed across various tumor sites with respect to age, disease stage, lymph node involvement, or distant metastases (Table 1), although a significant association was observed between age at diagnosis and disease stage, with younger age associated with more advanced stages (Table S1). The median age for patients with localized disease was 83 years whilst for advanced and metastatic was 67 and 63 years, respectively (p = 0.001). We also observed a statistically significant relationship between disease stage and smoking habit, with most patients in the metastatic group being smokers (90% vs. 33% and 39% in the localized and nodal stages, respectively, p = 0.02, Table S1).The Breslow depth was determined in 19 out of 35 patients, with a median value of 5.5 mm. Median Breslow depth increased with disease stage, although these differences were not statistically significant (Table S1).  3.3. MutationsAmong 35 MM cases, BRAF mutations were detected in three samples (8.6%, 95% CI: 1.8‚Äì23%), localized in exon 15 (p.V600D and p.V600E) and exon 11 (p.G466E). NRAS mutations were detected in two patients (5.7%, 95% CI: 0.7‚Äì19.2%), with changes at p.G13X and p.Q61X codons. The majority of cases (85.7%, 95% CI: 70‚Äì95%) were wild-type for both BRAF and NRAS. In six cases where c-KIT mutations were investigated, we found two positive cases (p.Y553C and p.Y578H) (33.3%, 95% CI: 4‚Äì77%) using a custom NGS panel. Additionally, a single TP53 (p.A159V) mutation was detected. No differences were found between MM location and BRAF mutation rate (p = 0.782) or between staging and BRAF mutation (p = 1; Table 1).  3.4. ManagementIn our study, the disease management strategy was meticulously determined by expert committees, taking into account available guidelines, patient and tumor characteristics, and disease staging. This comprehensive approach often involved a combination of surgical interventions, radiotherapy, and tailored systemic therapies (see Table 2).In the majority of patients, regardless of anatomical localization, tumor excision through surgery was the preferred approach (71.4%) (Table 2). Radiotherapy was not as common, employed in just 22.9% of patients. Systemic treatment was administered to 65.7% of patients, the majority (60.9%) receiving in an adjuvant setting after surgery, while nine patients received systemic treatment as their first option, either due to the extent of the disease or the impracticability of surgical intervention.In 34.8% of patients, the most frequently used first-line systemic therapeutic agents across the three distinct anatomical localizations were the anti-programmed cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., nivolumab or pembrolizumab). The predominant second-line choice was CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ipilimumab), utilized in 46.2% of patients, alongside with being the predominant third-line treatment option (33.3%). Table 2 provides an overview of the diverse treatments utilized, including their combinations.  3.5. Survival OutcomesInvestigating the survival outcomes in our cohort, we observed a 2-year survival rate of 43.5% (95% CI 29.4‚Äì64.2%) and a 5-year survival rate of 23.5% (95% CI 10.8‚Äì51.5%) (Figure 2). Among patients who died during the study period, the median time until this event occurred was 13 months.Kaplan‚ÄìMeier curves showed improved survival in patients with Breslow depths of less than 5 mm (p = 0.049, vs. ‚â•5 mm) (Figure 2). In multivariate Cox models, a greater Breslow depth was associated with a higher risk of death after adjusting for age, sex, and disease stage (HR: 1.51 95% CI: 1.13‚Äì2.01, p = 0.001) (Table 3). Different locations of MM (vulvovaginal, anorectal, or within the gastrointestinal tract) did not exhibit a definitive association with overall survival; however, the vulvovaginal subtype appeared to demonstrate a slightly more favorable prognosis. (Figure 2). When comparing vaginal and vulvar localization, our analysis of Kaplan‚ÄìMeier survival curves revealed a significantly lower survival rate in cases of vaginal MM at 12 months, with a rate of 40%, in contrast to a notably higher survival rate of 92% observed in vulvar MM cases (p-value from the log-rank test = 0.0037) (Figure S1). In unadjusted Cox models, vaginal melanoma was associated with a higher risk of death (HR: 9.25 95% CI: 1.58‚Äì54, p = 0.014) in comparison to vulvar melanoma. However, after adjusting for age and disease stage, this effect was attenuated (HR: 5.70 95% CI: 0.68‚Äì48, p = 0.11), as most vaginal melanomas were also diagnosed at later stages.In crude and adjusted analysis, both regional nodal involvement and/or distant metastases at diagnosis were significantly associated with worse survival (Figure 2 and Table 3). Survival worsened accordingly with increased disease stage with poorer prognosis in the nodal and metastatic stage (HR: 4.92 95% CI: 1.41‚Äì17.1 p = 0.01 and HR: 13.2 95% CI: 2.8‚Äì62 p = 0.001, respectively) in comparison to the localized stage (Figure 2 and Table 3).Regarding treatment options and survival outcomes, surgically intervened patients displayed improved survival (Figure 2). In age and sex adjusted models, surgical intervention also appeared as protective (HR: 0.25 95% CI: 0.08‚Äì0.74, p = 0.012), though this protective effect was not maintained after adjusting for disease stage (HR: 0.44 95% CI: 0.12‚Äì1.57, p = 0.2) (Table 3).  4. DiscussionOur retrospective analysis of MM within a cohort of 35 patients provides valuable insights into the epidemiological aspects, clinical characteristics, and outcomes associated with this uncommon yet highly aggressive malignancy.The observed higher incidence of MM among females compared to males (62.9% vs. 37.1%, p = 0.001) aligns with prior research [6,7,14,17]. This predominance in females can be attributed to the elevated occurrence of vulvovaginal melanoma, which represents the most frequently diagnosed subtype among women [4,5,8,18,19].Our patient cohort exhibited a median age of 70 years at presentation, a statistic in keeping with existing literature [7,8,20]. This median age at the time of diagnosis highlights the predominant occurrence of MM among older individuals, emphasizing the need for proactive early detection initiatives, particularly in anatomical regions where MM tends to be more prevalent.In our study, the most prevalent site was the vulvovaginal region, followed by the head and neck, and the digestive tract. Notably, this distribution differs from what is reported in the literature. Some studies suggest that the most common site is the head and neck, followed by vulvovaginal and anorectal locations [8,21,22], while others place anorectal ahead of vulvovaginal, with head and neck remaining the most frequent site [1,3,5,20,23,24]. Accurately estimating prevalence by location is challenging due to the rarity of this disease, leading to diverse prevalence percentages. Furthermore, the higher prevalence of vulvovaginalMM in our series may be attributed to our hospital‚Äôs Gynecological Oncology Department being a key referral center statewide, resulting in the referral of patients with this pathology to our center.No statistically significant relationships were found between the MM location and the staging at diagnosis, in contrast to other studies that reported a higher incidence of lymph node involvement in cases located in the anorectal region [4,5,7]. Similarly, no association was observed between the location and survival, aligning with some studies [25], while others reported worse survival outcomes in anorectal locations [21,22,26], or the best survival outcomes in vulvovaginal location [21]. In our series, there is a notable poorer survival for vaginal MM compared to vulvar MM, consistent with findings in other studies in the literature [27,28]. However, statistical significance diminishes when adjusted for stage, demonstrating that patients with nodal or metastatic involvement at diagnosis exhibit poorer survival, regardless of vulvar or vaginal localization.The diverse clinical presentations of MM across various anatomical sites highlight the diagnostic complexities associated with this condition. In our study, the most common symptoms included bleeding in vulvovaginal cases, rectorrhagia in anorectal cases, and varied symptoms depending on the specific location within the head and neck region. The high variability in clinical presentations of MM, its occurrence in anatomically challenging areas, and the potential for confusion with other pathologies, or the modesty of patients suffering from the condition delays medical consultations and, consequently, the diagnosis, often lead to disease progression, resulting in a more advanced stage at the time of diagnosis [1,4,5,20,22,29].We did not find a correlation between smoking habit and the occurrence of MM. In the literature, this lack of association is evident in the case of vulvovaginal and anorectal MM [30]. However, some studies do identify an increased risk of head and neck MM among smokers [31,32], while others posit that there is no connection, at least between lip MM and tobacco use [33]. An interesting finding in our series regarding smoking is the association between smoking habits and the presence of metastases at the time of diagnosis, a phenomenon not previously reported in the MM literature. Nevertheless, it has been noted that active smoking is linked to decreased utilization of breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening services. Additionally, active smokers who do not undergo appropriate screening face significantly higher odds of being diagnosed with advanced-stage breast or colorectal cancer [34].Our analysis revealed a significant correlation (p = 0.001) between younger age at diagnosis and a higher stage of MM. In particular, younger patients were inclined to exhibit more advanced disease stages. This age-staging relationship prompts intriguing inquiries concerning potential age-related distinctions in MM development, progression, or diagnostic methodologies that merit further investigation, as we did not find it documented in the existing literature.We also observed that patients with distant metastases (p = 0.001) and regional nodal involvement (p = 0.012) exhibited significantly inferior survival outcomes compared to individuals with localized disease, in accordance with what has been reported in the literature [3,21,25,26,35]. These results underscore the critical importance in considering metastatic status and nodal involvement when assessing prognosis and tailoring treatment strategies for MM patients.In our series, PET/CT stands out as the most frequently used imaging modality for detecting MM dissemination, consistent with its utility described in the majority of studies [3,30]. Selective sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was employed in only 15% of the patients. The role of SLNB in MM staging and management is currently under investigation, and its prognostic significance remains to be conclusively established [1,8].Tumor thickness (i.e., Breslow depth) is a crucial prognostic factor in CM [17], but its significance in MM remains debated. Notably, our study reveals that a Breslow index of less than 5 mm is linked to better survival in MM. Patel et al. found that thicker tumors (exceeding 5 mm) in MM of the head and neck correlated with poorer survival in their study of 59 patients [36]. Conversely, no prognostic relationship was observed for the Breslow index in anorectal MM by Yeh et al. [37]. Tcheung et al. reported a significant connection between an increased Breslow index and worse survival in their study of 85 vulvovaginal MM patients [38]. While some studies suggest that a Breslow index greater than 5 mm is an independent prognostic factor [14], Altieri et al., in their analysis of 1824 patients with MM, did not identify the Breslow index as a prognostic factor, but they did note reduced survival in patients with an unknown Breslow index (comprising 70% of their cohort) [26]. Despite the small sample size in our series, this is an intriguing finding from our study to consider.The BRAF mutations identified in our study align with findings from the existing literature [5,8,25,29,39,40,41]. Consistent with other series [29], our study did not establish a significant association between BRAF mutation status and either the localization or staging of MM. Moreover, it is important to note that the assessment of c-KIT mutations was limited to only six cases, thus precluding a comprehensive analysis of the relevance of c-KIT mutations in our cohort. Nevertheless, among the cases studied, 33% exhibited the mutation, consistent with the percentages reported in other series [8,20,22,25,41,42]. Additionally, one of the patients, who required systemic treatment, significantly benefited from targeted therapy using a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib) as a third-line treatment.Further investigation with a larger sample size is needed to explore the potential clinical implications of these genetic alterations in MM.Treatment strategies such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemo-/immunotherapy for MM lack randomized trials for specific guidance [43]. Surgical removal of the tumor with clear margins is the primary approach, but achieving complete resection can be challenging due to tumor size, anatomical complexity, functional considerations, and proximity to vital structures [1,41]. Complete tumor excision has been identified as a prognostic factor [21]. In our series, surgically treated patients exhibited enhanced survival, although this statistical significance dissipates when adjusted for staging.Radiotherapy is an option for adjuvant treatment or unresectable lesions [22]; however, its overall benefits remain uncertain. It may enhance local disease control without impacting overall survival [5,8,44].MM differs molecularly from CM, showing lower rates of BRAF V600 alterations and tumor mutational burden but a higher rate of chromosomal aberrations [1,45,46]. Adjuvant systemic therapy options for MM are limited, with systemic therapy for CM often recommended [43]. MM‚Äôs lower mutational burden and reduced PD-L1 expression might explain their relatively poorer response to immunotherapy compared to CM [8,23,40].Given the challenging outcomes and the lack of established treatments, participation in clinical trials is considered a standard of care for advanced-stage melanoma patients [43], including our center.In our series, first-line systemic treatment involved immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 agents, consistent with previous research [1,22]. Combining anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 agents is also a potential option, particularly for selected patients, although this can lead to increased toxicity [23,30,40,42]. For cases with c-KIT or BRAF mutations, targeted therapies may be considered [7,22,30,42], although durable responses remain unproven [23].Within our series, we have identified a consistent set of clinical and pathological characteristics in MM that independently predict overall survival (OS) through multifactorial analysis. These include tumor thickness, as previously mentioned, and the presence of metastases in regional lymph nodes or distant sites. Our observations align with findings from other studies [3,22,25,26,30], underscoring the paramount importance in early detection and timely intervention in MM cases, particularly those involving regional nodal involvement or distant metastases at the time of diagnosis.Regarding OS, we report a 2-year survival rate of less than 50% and a 5-year survival rate below 25%. These figures are in line with rates reported in the existing literature [1,3,4,26,41,45]. The fact that a significant proportion of patients in our cohort succumbed to this malignancy underscores the aggressive nature of MM.The findings of our series are in concordance with those of most previous studies, rendering them applicable and transferable to actual clinical practice in other specialized tertiary hospitals. Nonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent limitations in our study. These limitations include its retrospective and single-center design, which limits its external validity, makes it vulnerable to bias and incomplete data recollection, and the relatively modest sample size, which yielded imprecise estimates at times. Due to the small sample size, the high heterogeneity of cases, and the substantial variability in treatment regimens, it was not feasible to perform a comparative analysis of survival outcomes based on treatment combinations nor systemic therapies in this study.  5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, our retrospective analysis of MM has provided valuable insights into this rare yet highly aggressive malignancy. Significantly poorer survival outcomes were observed in cases with distant metastasis and regional nodal involvement compared to localized disease. Our findings suggest that tumor thickness, specifically a Breslow index of less than 5 mm, could serve as a potential prognostic factor in MM, correlating with improved survival rates, and underscores the correlation between more advanced stages at diagnosis and younger age. Finally, we highlight the presence of a notably high percentage of mutations in c-KIT.The treatment landscape for MM remains devoid of standardized guidelines, with surgery being the primary approach despite inherent challenges tied to tumor size and anatomical complexities. Immunotherapy emerges as a prevalent systemic treatment, though questions persist regarding optimal combination therapies and associated toxicities. The consideration of targeted therapies becomes crucial in cases involving mutations in BRAF or c-KIT. To advance our understanding of prognostic factors and treatment modalities in MM, future research endeavors involving larger cohorts are essential. Such efforts hold promise for enhancing our knowledge and management of MM.

      Clinical images of two patients affected with MM. (a) A 68-year-old woman presented with a heterochromatic lesion measuring 7 √ó 5 cm, involving the labia majora, minora and the clitoris, without palpable lymphadenopathies. A biopsy revealed melanoma with extensive superficial ulceration; (b) A 69-year-old woman presented with a left nasal wing bulging associated with a blackish mass visible through the left nostril. Biopsy confirmed the presence of melanoma, and PET-CT scans revealed paratracheal and supraclavicular lymphadenopathies.

AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma of the oral cavity



Authorship
                SCIMAGO INSTITUTIONS RANKINGS
            





A 25-year-old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was referred for consultation because of multiple intraoral lesions that had developed within past 2 months. Physical examination revealed diffuse multinodular purplish-red lesions with spontaneous bleeding affecting both the maxillary and mandibular gingiva (Figure 1). Histopathology of an incisional biopsy revealed a fascicular arrangement of spindle cells with congested blood vessels and hemorrhage in a telangiectatic pattern (Figure 2A). Immunohistochemistry for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) was diffusely positive (Figure 2B), confirming the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma (KS). Complete remission of the oral lesions was achieved after 16 months of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy. No signs of relapse were observed at 1 year post-treatment follow-up (Figure 3).

KS is a multifocal angioproliferative disorder associated with HHV-811. Bunn BK, Carvalho MV, Louw M, Vargas PA, van Heerden WF. Microscopic diversity in oral Kaposi sarcoma. Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol. 2013;115(2):241-8. Available from: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2012.11.009https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2012.11.0...
            . AIDS-related KS, the most common and aggressive variant, is the most frequent malignancy affecting people living with HIV22. Guedes PTL, Pontes FSC, Prado-Ribeiro AC, Rodrigues-Oliveira L, Brand√£o TB, Souza LL, et al. HIV-positive patients with oral Kaposi's sarcoma: An overall survival analysis of 31 patients. Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol . 2021;131(6):702-10. Available from: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2020.11.007https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2020.11.0...
            , in whom it often presents with mucocutaneous and/or visceral involvement. The oral cavity is affected in up to 70% of cases, and oral KS is sometimes the first manifestation of undiagnosed HIV infection11. Bunn BK, Carvalho MV, Louw M, Vargas PA, van Heerden WF. Microscopic diversity in oral Kaposi sarcoma. Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol. 2013;115(2):241-8. Available from: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2012.11.009https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2012.11.0...
            . According to the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, extensive oral involvement is a sign of advanced KS that worsens survival33. Freeman EE, McCann NC, Semeere A, Reddy KP, Laker-Oketta M, Byakwaga H, et al. Evaluation of four chemotherapy regimens for treatment of advanced AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma in Kenya: a cost-effectiveness analysis. Lancet Glob Health. 2022;10(8):e1179-e1188. Available from: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(22)00242-Xhttps://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(22)00...
            . Although ART plays an important role in KS prevention and improves survival, factors such as delayed diagnosis, suboptimal linkage to care, and limited access to effective chemotherapy regimens hinder the management of advanced KS, especially in low- and middle-income countries22. Guedes PTL, Pontes FSC, Prado-Ribeiro AC, Rodrigues-Oliveira L, Brand√£o TB, Souza LL, et al. HIV-positive patients with oral Kaposi's sarcoma: An overall survival analysis of 31 patients. Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol . 2021;131(6):702-10. Available from: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2020.11.007https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2020.11.0...

Abstract


Although microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) recurs and expands locally without metastases to the lymph nodes and other organs, its biological behavior remains unknown. In this report, a case of a giant MAC on the back treated with radical excision and curative radiation therapy and its characteristic dermoscopic findings are presented. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 28 on the tumor cells and MMP12 and periostin in the stroma. The present case suggests the possible biological behaviors of MAC and might provide a possible target for the treatment of MAC in the future.

Introduction


Microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) is an indolent but deeply infiltrative tumor with a high propensity for perineural invasion [1]. MAC characteristically recurs and expands locally without metastases to the lymph nodes and other organs [1, 2]. Since MAC can extend far beyond the clinical margin, its treatment is challenging [1-3]. In this report, a case of MMP28-expressing MAC on the back with MMP12 and periostin (POSTN) in the cancer stroma is presented.


Case Report


A 55-year-old Japanese woman visited our outpatient clinic with an infiltrated, easy-to-bleed tumor on her back. She was aware of her tumor 30 years earlier. On her initial visit, physical examination showed an infiltrated red tumor, 10 cm √ó 5.5 cm in size, on the back (Fig.¬†1a). Dermoscopy showed a whitish mesh-like structure with arborizing vessels (Fig.¬†1b). MRI findings suggested tumor infiltrating into the latissimus dorsi (Fig.¬†1c). A biopsy specimen showed numerous keratinous cysts and small islands of basaloid and squamous epithelium with ductal differentiation throughout the superficial to deep dermis (Fig.¬†2a). In addition, smaller nests and strands of cells in a desmoplastic stroma (Fig.¬†2b) with nerve invasion (Fig.¬†2c, d) were prominent in the deep dermis. On immunohistochemical staining, these tumor cells were positive for AE1/AE3 and negative for CEA and BerEP4. From the above findings, the diagnosis was MAC on the back with nerve invasion. The tumor was excised with a 30-mm margin and part of the latissimus dorsi and trapezius muscles. In addition to surgical treatment, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (60 Gy: 2.0 Gy √ó 30 fractions) was given as adjuvant therapy. Nine months after intensive treatment, her tumor was still under control.

Since the dermoscopic and histological finding suggested fibrosis and vascularization of the tumor, to further investigate the possible biological behaviors of MAC, immunohistochemical staining for MMP12, MMP28, and POSTN, which correlate with angiogenesis and fibrosis of skin tumors, was performed. The MMP12 expression (Fig.¬†3a) was weakly positive at stroma compared to positive (Fig.¬†3b) and negative (Fig.¬†3c) control. POSTN (Fig.¬†3d) was highly expressed in the cancer stroma that showed the desmoplastic findings of MAC, whereas MMP28 (Fig.¬†3g) was expressed on tumor cells. In addition, positive and negative controls for POSTN (Fig.¬†3e, f) and MMP28 (Fig.¬†3h, i) were presented.

Discussion


MAC, also known as sclerosing sweat duct carcinoma, is a rare malignant cutaneous tumor of the skin with pilar and eccrine differentiation [6]. It is a locally aggressive, indolent, but infiltrative tumor, potentially invasive from dermis to muscle, adipose tissue, and nerves [6]. The characteristic histological features of MAC are small keratin-filled cysts, islands of basaloid keratinocytes, and ductal structure surrounded by desmoplastic stroma [6]. In addition, the dermoscopic findings in the present case showed a prominent whitish mesh-like structure with arborizing vessels, suggesting fibrosis and vascularization of the tumor. From the above findings, it was hypothesized that several MMPs might play roles in characterizing of biological behavior of MAC.


MMPs play significant roles in cancer formation. Among them, MMP12 is a potent protease that inhibits tumor angiogenesis and metastasis by catalyzing the formation of antiangiogenic peptides [7]. In skin cancer, decreased levels of MMP12 could be correlated with vascularization, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion of SCC and EMPD [4]. MMP28 plays a role in remodeling the newly formed basement membrane during wound repair [8] and is even highly expressed in sclerosing diseases such as limited-type scleroderma [9]. In addition to MMP28, POSTN is a matrix cellular protein that induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1Œ≤ and TNF-Œ± from fibroblasts, leading to the development of fibrosing diseases [10]. Furthermore, POSTN promotes the production of MMP12 from M2 macrophages [11]. Since MAC is abundant in the desmoplastic area and the highly vascularized skin tumor that infiltrates deeply into the dermis, these MMPs and POSTN might be highly expressed by MAC. In fact, in the present case, the cancer stroma possessed POSTN and MAC cells expressed MMP28, but density of MMP12 in cancer stroma was relatively low compared to basal cell carcinoma. Since MAC can extend far beyond the clinical margin and can recur years after initial treatment, its treatment is challenging [1]. Although a previous report suggested the efficacy of radiotherapy for MAC [12], in most cases, chemotherapy was ineffective [13]. Therefore, additional treatments for MAC are needed. Notably, several drugs such as bisphosphonates, statins, and tetracyclines have already been reported to modulate the production of MMPs and even to improve the prognosis of cancer patients [14, 15]. Indeed, previous reports suggested that bisphosphonates might enhance the therapeutic effect of docetaxel in cutaneous angiosarcoma [16, 17]. These reports suggest the potential benefit of bisphosphonates, statins, and tetracyclines to improve the prognosis of MMPs-bearing MACs.


Conclusion


The present case suggests the possible biological behaviors of MAC and might provide a possible target for the treatment of MAC in the future.

Abstract

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) is a rare malignant neoplasm of ductal origin. MAC is a clinically aggressive, locally destructive tumor with a high rate of recurrence, but distant metastasis is rare. A 55-year-old male who had been taking immunosuppressants for 2 years after a liver transplantation due to hepatocellular carcinoma presented with a dermal nodule on the sole. He visited the clinic because the nodule, discovered 3 months ago, continued to increase in size. The histopathologic findings from the lesion were consistent with MAC. The patient underwent wide local excision and confirmed a histologically negative margin. After 11 months, the patient revisited with multiple skin nodules on the buttock, back, and right forearm that were distant from the primary tumor site. The lesions were histologically confirmed as MAC. We report a rare case of MAC with distant metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) is an unusual and locally aggressive neoplasm of ductal origin with preponderance for local recurrence. Most often these neoplasms present as solitary flesh-colored indurated plaques on the upper lip1. Possible triggers include UV exposure, immunosuppression, and radiotherapy had been suggested1. A large primary tumor size is associated with the risk factor for recurrence1. However, distant metastasis is extremely rare1, and the associated risk factors are not known yet. The following presentation is a rare case of metastatic MAC with a review of literature reports of distant metastases.

CASE REPORT

A 55-year-old male presented with an asymptomatic dermal nodule on the right heel that was recognized 3 months ago. The patient had a medical history of high blood pressuere, diabetes, chronic kidney disease stage 3, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and liver transplantation due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 2 years ago and had been taking immunosuppressant, tacrolimus 2 mg daily. Patient did not report any other dermatologic history of photo damage, radiotherapy, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. We received the patient‚Äôs consent form about publishing all photographic materials. Physical examination revealed a 9 mm-sized, hyperkeratotic dermal nodule on the right heel (Fig. 1A). A 4-mm punch biopsy revealed diffuse infiltration of ductal structures between hyalinized stroma (Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemical examination was positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and negative for CK20 (Fig. 1C~E). As thyroid transcription factor 1 and glypican-3 were also negative, metastatic HCC and lung adenocarcinoma could be excluded. The nodule was diagnosed as MAC based on the clinical and histological findings. The patient underwent wide local excision with a 1-cm margin including the entire dermis. Histologically, malignant cells were not seen within 8 mm from the tissue edge and 2.6 mm from the deep margin, however, there was a perineural invasion.

After 11 months, the patient revisited our clinic and presented with multiple pale-pink nodules on the buttock, back and right forearm (Fig. 2A). A punch biopsy was performed on the right forearm and showed the identical findings as previous biopsy (Fig. 2B). Immunohistochemical examination was positive for CK7, EMA and negative for CK20 (Fig. 2C~E). Additional bone scan and Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) performed and revealed that multiple increased uptakes in both arms, buttock, and both lower legs, and multiple bones (Fig. 3). No lymph node metastasis was detected. The patient was referred to a tertiary hospital and died of heart failure 2 months later after single cycle of chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION

MAC is an uncommon cutaneous malignant neoplasm that is associated with significant morbidity in light of its propensity for local invasion2. Although the pathophysiology is unclear, possible causes include ultraviolet radiation, prior radiation therapy, and immunocompromised states1. Histopathologically, it is characterized by diffuse infiltrating syringomatous ductal differentiation. Differential diagnoses include desmoplastic trichoepithelioma (DTE) and morpheaform basal cell carcinoma (mBCC). Immunostaining is useful to differentiate2 MAC from both disease. Carcinoembryonic antigen, EMA, CK20 is useful to rule out DTE and Ber-ep4 is useful to rule out mBCC1.
MAC is locally invasive tumor that frequently extends into deep tissues including subcutaneous fat, muscle and bone, even beyond the clinical margin2. However, despite of the locally invasive nature, distant metastasis is very rare. Only five cases of metastasis have been reported to date2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Of these, the location of the primary tumor was the face in three cases, the scalp in one case and the hand in one case. The time to diagnosis of distant metastasis was more than 20 years for two cases, 5 to 10 years for one case and less than 5 years for two cases. For the cases of distant metastasis that were diagnosed within 5 years, one was in an immunocompromised patient, and the other was in a patient with a primary tumor in the extremity (Table 1).

In this case, the primary tumor was in the right sole and the patient had a history of taking immunosuppressive agent. It is known that non-melanoma skin cancers in organ transplant patients show an increased risk of incidence and aggressive subclinical extension7. It is also known that cutaneous adnexal tumor is more likely to occur in organ transplant patients8. In cutaneous adnexal tumor, poor prognostic factors for overall survival include increasing age, node and distant metastasis, high tumor stage and untreated cases9. The study conducted on adnexal tumors showing eccrine differentiation reported that the higher the stage and poorer tumor differentiation, the poorer overall survival10. MAC reports that large tumor size increases secondary morbidity, but there is no report on factors related to tumor aggressiveness1. Well-designed cohort or prospective studies are needed to clarify the risk factors for MAC aggressiveness.

Abstract:
Background: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare type of neuroendocrine tumor. Palpebral localization represents 2.5% of MCCs. Surgery is not always possible due to the localization or comorbidities of elderly patients. We hypothesized that radiotherapy (RT) alone could be a curative treatment in patients contraindicated for oncological surgery. Methods: We performed a retrospective monocentric study of patients with localized eyelid MCC treated with curative intent using curative radiotherapy. Results: Overall, 11 patients with histologically confirmed eyelid MCC were treated with curative radiotherapy. The median age was 77 years old (range: 53‚Äì94). Curative RT was decided mainly due to difficult localization and significant co-morbidities. The median lesion dose was 57 Gy (range: 47‚Äì70). Most patients had adjuvant lymph nodes irradiation with a median dose of 50 Gy (n = 9; 82%). The median follow-up was 62 months (6‚Äì152 months). None of the seven deaths were MCC-related. None of our patients relapsed during follow-up. Side effects related to radiotherapy were mild (no grade ‚â• 2) and rare (n = 3, 21%). Conclusion: Our data suggest that curative radiotherapy is an effective and safe treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma of the eyelid and periocular region. Radiotherapy alone allows limiting the aesthetic and functional sequelae in elderly and comorbid patients who are contraindicated for oncological surgery.

  1. IntroductionMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive neuroectodermal primary skin cancer. Its incidence ranges from 0.11 to 0.4 cases per 100,000 in Europe. This aggressive tumor has a high risk of recurrence at around 25 to 50%; overall survival at 5 years ranges from 41 to 70% [1,2,3,4,5]. Although cellular etiology of MCC is unclear [6], risk factors include being elderly [7], UV exposure and immunodepression [8,9,10]. Its incidence is increasing over time due to an aging population, higher amounts of sun exposure, and better diagnostic methods and case registrations [11]. MCC is associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), skin squamous cell carcinoma, and other cancers [7,12,13]. MCC presents as an asymptomatic rapidly growing, erythematous, or purple nodule in sun-exposed skin, mainly on the head or neck.Nearly 200 cases of MCC located on the eyelid have been reported [14], which represent 2.5% of all MCCs [15]. The clinical characteristics of primary eyelid MCC are no different from other locations. Unlike basal cell carcinoma, MCC occurs twice as frequently on the upper eyelid [14,16]. Macroscopically, MCC can be misdiagnosed as a dermal cyst, chalazion, basal cell carcinoma, nodular angiosarcoma, or metastasis [16]. A size of 20 mm is usually used to determine the classification of MCC. Most of the previously reported orbital and eyelid MCCs had a diameter of 20 mm or less [17], with a median size of 15 mm [14]. This led to the use of the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification criteria for eyelid carcinoma rather than the MCC criteria to achieve a more consistent T-category designation [18,19,20].The diagnosis requires histological validation, using immunohistochemistry including CK-20 and TTF-1 immunomarkers to avoid misdiagnosis with lymphoma or small-cell lung carcinoma metastasis [21,22,23]. Eyelid MCC has a 20% risk of nodal metastasis on initial diagnosis [19]. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is recommended in Europe [23,24], but due to the age of patients and poor general estate, SLNB is rarely carried out on these patients [14]. Because of early and rapid discomfort, eyelid lesions are diagnosed earlier and have a better prognosis [14].The standard care of MCC is wide local excision of the lesion with a negative lateral margin of 20 mm. An adjuvant radiation therapy to the primary tumor site is also recommended [21,23]. Without a clearly identified recommendation, a complete excision with a margin of at least 5 mm seems acceptable on the eyelid. [18,25] Mohs‚Äô micrographic surgery may also be an appropriate method [23,26]. If the primary tumor is small, i.e., <10 mm, and widely excised with no other adverse risk factors such as lymphovascular invasion or immunosuppression, observation of the primary site may be considered. RT of the nodes is necessary when there is a risk of a false-negative nodal evaluation. RT should also be discussed in cases of profound immunosuppression [21,23,24].Wide local excision may have aesthetic and functional impacts on patients. Furthermore, surgery has a high complication risk in elderly patients with many comorbidities. Indeed, our team previously reported that curative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) yields acceptable oncological results for early MCC. Both studies of Mortier et al. and Pape et al. found no statistical differences in overall and disease-free survival between surgery plus radiotherapy or EBRT [27,28]. More recently, Dubois et al. compared 31 patients treated with surgery with a 2 cm clear margin followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and 53 patients treated with EBRT. No statistical difference was found for nodal relapse, metastatic relapse, disease-free survival, or overall survival. Hence, EBRT for early MCC leads to a similar oncological outcome as combined treatment, with fewer aesthetic sequelae [29].We conducted a retrospective study to describe the management and the outcome of patients with eyelid Merkel cell carcinomas treated by curative radiotherapy.  2. Materials and Methods  2.1. PopulationWe reviewed the medical records of patients with eyelid MCC treated in our university center of Lille from 1999 to 2019. Diagnosis was confirmed histologically in all cases with a skin biopsy sample revealing a positive immunohistochemical staining for CK7-negative patients, and CK20- and neuron-specific enolase-positive patients. We included patients with localized disease, presenting as a unique tumor. Eyelid localization included the eyelid and the eyebrow. We excluded patients with localized disease in other places different from this location. Patients were included regardless of comorbidities, including hematological diseases. Lymph node involvement was assessed via imaging (either by ultrasound or CT scan). We excluded patients treated with surgery with a ‚â•0.5 cm margin or patients with lymph node metastasis. We staged the disease using the AJCC classification of Merkel cell carcinoma and eyelid carcinomas.  2.2. TreatmentMCC primary tumors were surgically excised to achieve negative surgical margins when possible. No chemotherapy or immunotherapy were performed. All patients received curative radiotherapy. The radiotherapy technique was variable according to treatment centers, and according to available radiation techniques at the time of treatment for all patients (3D, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, electron radiotherapy).  2.3. Statistical AnalysisData are expressed as numbers (percentages) for categorical variables, and median for quantitative variables.  2.4. EthicsThere was no opposition from any of the patients included in the study for the use of their anonymized medical data, according to Jarde‚Äôs Law (March 2012) for retrospective data publications. This study has been declared and accepted by the CNIL (Commission Nationale Informatique et Libert√©s), the organization in charge of the ethical use of data collected for scientific purposes in France (DEC20-135)  3. Results  3.1. Patients‚Äô CharacteristicsA total of 11 patients with eyelid MCC were included. Most of them were women (7/11, 64%) with a median age of 77 years old [range 53‚Äì94 yo]. One patient had a history of Hodgkin lymphoma. The median size of the tumor was 13.2 mm [5‚Äì20 mm]. Most of the lesions were at stage T2N0M0 (6/11, 55%). Localizations were the eyelid for six patients (55%), more particularly, the upper eyelid (5/6, 83%), and on the eyebrow for the last five patients (5/11 (45%)) (Table 1).  3.2. TreatmentsAll patients were treated via curative EBRT. Three patients had a surgical biopsy with excision with insufficient margins of 0.1 cm. Of the six patients with an eyelid localization, five received curative radiotherapy (86%), and only one underwent surgical biopsy with excision with insufficient margins of 0.1 cm. None of our patients needed exenteration regardless of the treatment strategy or the localization of the eyelid. None had sentinel lymph node biopsy. None of our patients were treated with Mohs micrographic surgery (Table 2).  3.3. IrradiationThe median dose of radiation on the lesion was 57 Gy (47‚Äì70 Gy). For the six patients with MCC of the eyelid, the median dose was 57 Gy (47‚Äì70 Gy). Four of these six patients treated with radiotherapy without surgery were given a boost. The median dose of the boost was 12 Gy (8‚Äì20 Gy). Most of the patients had lymph node irradiation (9/11; 82%). The median dose delivered to the lymph nodes was 50 Gy (43‚Äì51). The techniques used were electrons, orthovoltage radiotherapy, 3D radiotherapy,y and IMRT. Five patients were treated with hypofractionned radiotherapy (3/11; 27%), with the median number of fractions being 15 [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18].  3.4. OutcomesThe median follow-up was 62 months (6‚Äì152). No patient had a local or metastatic relapse. A total of seven patients (64%) died during the follow-up; all were free of disease at the time of death. Causes of death were cardiac, infectious, or related to advanced age. Side effects of radiotherapy were mild and rare (3/11; 27%). The reported side effects were: alopecia of the eyebrow, radioepithelis, conjontivitis, and epistaxis (Table 2, Figure 1 and Figure 2).  4. DiscussionThe management of eyelid Merkel cell carcinoma is mainly based on cases series [14,16,18,25]. Around 200 cases have been published and recently reviewed [14]. Data from randomized trials are not available due to the rarity of MCC. When the primary tumor is located on the eyelid, broad excision with a 20 mm margin is rarely feasible. Excision with a 5 mm margin to achieve tumor-free margin is accepted. The use of adjunctive radiotherapy is up to practitioners‚Äô appreciation, although it is highly recommended by some authors [14,18,25].However, some elderly patients may not be eligible for such surgery because of comorbidities and/or localization or extension of the tumor. The question then arises: what alternative treatment can be proposed to these patients who are at risk? In the present study, we report the results of 11 patients (77 years old) with localized eyelid MCC who were contraindicated for oncological surgery and treated with curative radiotherapy (RT). Our data suggest that curative RT is an effective and safe option for the treatment of eyelid MCC in elderly and comorbid patients. Curative radiotherapy provides good oncological outcomes and allows limiting aesthetic and functional sequelae. At a median follow-up of 62 months, side effects related to radiotherapy were rare (3, 27%) and mild (no grade > 2). None of the seven deaths were MCC-related. Our results confirm that radiotherapy can be the curative treatment for eyelid MCC in elderly patients who are not eligible for surgery, or when surgery would be overaggressive because the tumor is already too extended.In 1999, Kivel√§ et al. [30] were the first authors to suggest that radiation may be used as the primary and exclusive treatment for eyelid-localized MCC if the patient did not tolerate surgery or the tumor encroached vital structures such as the eye. Overall, only six cases of eyelid lesions were treated with curative radiotherapy (Table 3). Our data compare favorably with those already reported in the literature [28,29,30,31,32].To our knowledge, we report the largest case series of curative radiotherapy as a treatment strategy for eyelid-localized MCC ‚â§ 20 mm (T2N0M0), on in-place lesion or after surgery with insufficient oncological margins. Of the 11 patients treated with curative radiotherapy, none have relapsed after this care, and all patients died from unrelated causes. Radiotherapy was well tolerated even in the seven patients treated on the eyelid. On these patients, curative RT treatment without surgery with 5 mm margins led to a control of the pathology.In the largest case series published to date, Herbert et al., reported the outcomes of 21 patients with MCC of the eyelid [18]. It is the largest cohort evaluating ophthalmologic localisazation of MCC treated with surgery. Some cases were treated with an association of radiation therapy. Similarly to our patients, the majority of their cases with MCC of the eyelid presented with localized eyelid disease. All patients underwent surgery with mostly a wide local excision with margin control (85%) and more than half (57%) received adjuvant radiotherapy for the eyelids, regional nodes, and intervening tissue following a wide local excision. Overall, 6 of the 12 MCC patients (T2aN0M0; 57%), comparable to our cohort, were treated with adjunctive local radiotherapy. One patient developed both regional nodal and distant metastatic recurrent disease 6 months after surgery, even though the primary lesion was small (8mm). This patient did not receive adjunctive radiotherapy. This emphasizes the importance of radiotherapy in the management of MCC. Within a median of 36 months, no other patient with a MCC < 20 mm experienced recurrence. None of their patients were treated with curative radiotherapy [18]. Nevertheless, our population is comparable to other published cases of eyelid MCC, particularly with localized lesions < 20 mm as noted by Herbert et al. Our patients treated with curative radiotherapy having similar characteristics to patients of this cohort who received wide local excision with a 5 mm margin and adjunctive radiotherapy did not seem to have a worse prognosis or side effects. The monocentric character, although usually a limitation of the case series, is a guarantee of homogeneity of management in our cohort. One may wonder why none of our patients had SLBN. This procedure was not carried out due to the old age and poor general estate to our patient in balance with the invasive nature of the surgery with a high rate of false negatives in the cervical region.In our eyelid MCC case series, we found that lesions arise on the upper eyelid rather than the lower. This particularity was also noted in other reviews [14,18]. Authors explain this difference by a higher sun exposure on the upper eyelid [16]. However, basal cell carnicomas are also UV-related lesions, and appear to be more frequent in the lower eyelid [36]. Moreover, we noted that eyebrow MCCs appear to be more frequent in the hair follicle. The origins of MCC remain debatable. Some authors found the origins to be in Merkel cells. These cells are specialized in the light-touch responses derived from epidermal stem cells [37,38] or neural progenitors [39]. In both cases, as follicles are associated with epidermal stem cells and touch receptors, this could explain the localization close to hair follicles on eyebrows or eyelashes on upper eyelid.In locally advanced MCC, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy had a good outcome [40]. Several cases of spontaneous or post-biopsy regression have been reported, suggesting the possible effectiveness of immunotherapy as in the treatment of melanoma [16,18,41,42]. Checkpoint inhibitors are validated in metastatic MCCs [43,44]. Lipson et al. showed that an endogenous immune response promotes PD-L1 expression in the MCC microenvironment and provides a rationale for investigating therapies blocking PD-1/PD-L1 for patients with MCC, and could be related to overall survival [45].Guidelines from the NCCN currently recommend consideration of immunotherapy for patients with metastatic MCC or recurrent locally advanced MCC unamenable to definitive resection or RT. Neoadjuvant strategy off protocol is currently not a standard of care [21]. Topalian et al. showed that preoperative anti PD1 for patients with MCPyV-positive, resectable MCC was generally tolerable and induced pathological complete response and radiographic tumor regressions in approximately one half of treated patients [46]. In complex and non-operable MCC of the eyelid in elderly patients with contraindications for receiving chemotherapy, neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with RT could be interesting.  5. ConclusionsTo conclude, our results suggest that curative radiotherapy is a safe and effective alternative to surgery for eyelid-localized MCC, in patients with comorbidities or when surgery would lead to aesthetic or functional sequelae. If treated via surgery, rapid local and nodal adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered.
